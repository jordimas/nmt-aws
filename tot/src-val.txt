Grouped search terms are search names that permit a query to automatically search across more than one column. For example if you create a grouped search term allseries with the value series #myseries #myseries2 then the query allseriesadhoc will find 'adhoc' in any of the columns series #myseries and #myseries2. Enter the name of the grouped search term in the drop-down box enter the list of columns to search in the value box then push the Save button. Note Search terms are forced to lower case; MySearch and mysearch are the same term.You can have your grouped search term show up as User categories in  the Tag browser. Just add the grouped search term names to the Make User categories from box. You can add multiple terms separated by commas. The new User category will be automatically populated with all the items in the categories included in the grouped search term. Automatic User categories permit you to see easily all the category items that are in the columns contained in the grouped search term. Using the above allseries example the automatically-generated User category will contain all the series mentioned in series #myseries and #myseries2. This can be useful to check for duplicates to find which column contains a particular item or to have hierarchical categories (categories that contain categories).

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
Specifying the template languages
Specifying the paths to translator inputs
Specifying the documents to translate
Translating documentation is not very difficult in itself. Texts are far longer than the messages of the program and thus take longer to be achieved but no technical skill is really needed to do so. The difficult part comes when you have to maintain your work. Detecting which parts did change and need to be updated is very difficult error-prone and highly unpleasant. I guess that this explains why so much translated documentation out there are outdated.
The po4a answers
So the whole point of po4a is to make the documentation translation I. The idea is to reuse the gettext methodology to this new field. Like in gettext texts are extracted from their original locations in order to be presented in a uniform format to the translators. The classical gettext tools help them updating their works when a new release of the original comes out. But to the difference of the classical gettext model the translations are then re-injected in the structure of the original document so that they can be processed and distributed just like the English version.
Thanks to this discovering which parts of the document were changed and need an update becomes very easy. Another good point is that the tools will make almost all the work when the structure of the original document gets fundamentally reorganized and when some chapters are moved around merged or split. By extracting the text to translate from the document structure it also keeps you away from the text formatting complexity and reduces your chances to get a broken document (even if it does not completely prevent you to do so).
Please also see the B below in this document for a more complete list of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.
Even with these advantages some people don't like the idea of translating each paragraph separately. Here are some of the answers I can give to their fear
This approach proved successfully in the KDE project and allows people there to produce the biggest corpus of translated and up to date documentation I know.
The translators can still use the context to translate since the strings in the PO file are in the same order than in the original document. Translating sequentially is thus rather comparable whether you use po4a or not.  And in any case the best way to get the context remains to convert the document to a printable format since the text formatting ones are not really readable IMHO.
This approach is the one used by professional translators. I agree that they have somewhat different goals than open-source translators. The maintenance is for example often less critical to them since the content changes rarely.
Why not to split on sentence level (or smaller)?
Putting 'E' and 'E' in translations
Since these chars are used to delimit parts under font modification you can't use them verbatim. Use EEltE and EEgtE instead (as in POD one more time).
Activate debugging for some internal mechanisms of this module.  Use the source to see which parts can be debugged.
AUTHORING MAN PAGES COMPLIANT WITH PO4AMAN
This module is still very limited and will always be because it's not a real nroff interpreter. It would be possible to do a real nroff interpreter to allow authors to use all the existing macros or even to define new ones in their pages but we didn't want to. It would be too difficult and we thought it wasn't necessary. We do think that if manpages' authors want to see their productions translated they may have to adapt to ease the work of translators.
The adaptation for po4a was done by
LocalePo4aTeX - convert TeX documents and derivates from/to PO files
LocalePo4aTeX is a module to help the translation of TeX documents into other [human] languages. It can also be used as a base to build modules for TeX-based documents.
TRANSLATING WITH PO4ATEX
This module can be used directly to handle generic TeX documents.  This will split your document in smaller blocks (paragraphs verbatim blocks or even smaller like titles or indexes).
stats()
Returns some statistics about the translation done so far. Please note that it's not the same statistics than the one printed by msgfmt --statistic. Here it's stats about recent usage of the PO file while msgfmt reports the status of the file. It is a wrapper to the LocalePo4aPostatsget function applied to the input PO file. Example of use
[normal use of the po4a document]
Manipulating addenda
addendum($)
joinlines(@)
This function returns a simple string with the text from the argument array (discarding the references).

If the provider or transport service offers a page or web site to check the status of your shipments you may enter it here. You can use the key {TRACKID} in the URL parameters so the system will replace it with the tracking number the user entered into the shipment card.
When you create a lead you will define an estimated amount of project/lead. According to status of the lead this amount may be multiplied by this rate to evaluate a total amount all your leads may generate. Value is a percentage (between 0 and 100).

The Image module allows you to manipulate images on your website. It exposes a setting for using the Image toolkit allows you to configure Image styles that can be used for resizing or adjusting images on display and provides an Image field for attaching images to content. For more information see the online handbook entry for Image module.
Manipulating images
With the Image module you can scale crop resize rotate and desaturate images without affecting the original image using image styles. When you change an image style the module automatically refreshes all created images. Every image style must have a name which will be used in the URL of the generated images. There are two common approaches to naming image styles (which you use will depend on how the image style is being applied)

The Node module manages the creation editing deletion settings and display of the main site content. Content items managed by the Node module are typically displayed as pages on your site and include a title some meta-data (author creation time content type etc.) and optional fields containing text or other data (fields are managed by the Field module). For more information see the online handbook entry for Node module.
Creating content
Any safe
The Testing module provides a framework for running automated unit tests. It can be used to verify a working state of Drupal before and after any code changes or as a means for developers to write and execute tests for their modules. For more information see the online handbook entry for Testing module.
Running tests
Visit the Testing page to display a list of available tests. For comprehensive testing select all tests or individually select tests for more targeted testing. Note that it might take several minutes for all tests to complete. For more information on creating and modifying your own tests see the Testing API Documentation in the Drupal handbook.
After the tests run a message will be displayed next to each test group indicating whether tests within it passed failed or had exceptions. A pass means that the test returned the expected results while fail means that it did not. An exception normally indicates an error outside of the test such as a PHP warning or notice. If there were failures or exceptions the results will be expanded to show details and the tests that had failures or exceptions will be indicated in red or pink rows. You can then use these results to refine your code and tests until all tests pass.
Regularly review available updates to maintain a secure and current site. Always run the update script each time a module is updated.

Maintaining translations
If editing content in one language requires that translated versions also be updated to reflect the change use the Flag translations as outdated check box to mark the translations as outdated and in need of revision. Individual translations may also be marked for revision by selecting the This translation needs to be updated check box on the translation editing form.
There is already a translation in this language.

A space-separated list of HTML tags allowed in the content of feed items. Disallowed tags are stripped from the content.
No URL aliases available. Add URL alias.
To provide keyword searching the search engine maintains an index of words found in the content and its fields along with text added to your content by other modules (such as comments from the core Comment module and taxonomy terms from the core Taxonomy module). To build and maintain this index a correctly configured cron maintenance task is required. Users with Administer search permission can further configure the cron settings on the Search settings page.

Reference for usage configuration and modules.
The RDF module enriches your content with metadata to let other applications (e.g. search engines aggregators and so on) better understand its relationships and attributes. This semantically enriched machine-readable output for Drupal sites uses the RDFa specification which allows RDF data to be embedded in HTML markup. Other modules can define mappings of their data to RDF terms and the RDF module makes this RDF data available to the theme. The core Drupal modules define RDF mappings for their data model and the core Drupal themes output this RDF metadata information along with the human-readable visual information. For more information see the online handbook entry for RDF module.

Voting eligibility is defined uniquely for each election and refer to groups configured in the Fedora Account System at .
To be able to vote you must be a member of at least one group listed or match the special eligibility criteria defined in 
The Date amp; Time screen allows you to configure time and date-related settings for your system. This screen is automatically configured based on the settings you selected in  but you can change your date time and location settings before you begin the installation.
First select your Region using the drop-down menu in the top left corner of the screen. Then select your City or the city closest to your location in the same time zone. Selecting a specific location helps PRODUCT; ensure that your time is always set correctly including automatic time changes for daylight savings time if applicable.
You can also select a time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) without setting your location to a specific region. To do so select Etc as your region.
The list of cities and regions comes from the Time Zone Database (tzdata) public domain which is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The Fedora Project can not add cities or regions into this database. You can find more information at the IANA official website.
The switch labeled Network Time in the top right corner of the screen can be used to enable or disable network time synchronization using the Network Time Protol (NTP). Enabling this option will keep your system time correct as long as the system can access the internet. By default four NTP pools are configured; you can add others and disable or remove the default ones by clicking the gear wheel button next to the switch.

File Servers
NFS Ganesha File Server
The NFS Ganesha file server is a new package in F21. It is a user-mode file server for NFS (v3 v4.0  v4.1 pNFS) and for 9P from the Plan 9 operating system. It integrates with backend filesystems via its File System Abstraction Layer (FSAL) which is a set of loadable modules that implement the access to these filesystems. Using a FSAL is similar to FUSE in that the whole filesystem can be implemented in user space. This is especially advantageous for pNFS and distributed filesystems where storage is distributed across a network.

Initramfs Changes
Please note that a new initramfs is only automatically generated by the kernel-core package but not the kernel-modules package. If you only installed kernel-core at first and install kernel-modules at a later point in time you need to create a new initramfs manually using dracut if any of the newly installed modules has become critical for your system's boot up.
The dracut utility is used to create the initramfs on Fedora. To regenerate an initramfs for all installed kernels use the following command
# dracut --regenerate-all

SSSD GPO-Based Access Control
SSSD now supports centrally managed host-based access control in an Active Directory (AD) environment using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
Why does hg tells me the repository doesn't exist even though I know I have the correct URL?
Unfortunately hg doesn't use true URLs.  You have to use a "/" as a delimiter between hostname and path and a second "/" as the root of the filesystem path.  For instance if you're accessing the repository for authconfig you need to use "hg clone ssh//hg.fedorahosted.org//hg/authconfig"
Can I offer pre-compiled binaries on Fedora Hosted?
You may as long as the following conditions are met The code project must be available under a Free Software license appropriate for Fedora.You must make the source code you used to build the binaries available and not distributed in the same tarball or at a minimum make available a "source only" tarball.You must provide clear instructions for building the software.

Fedora Workstation does also support the ARM architecture.
The Fedora Cloud Working Group offers two variants for different use cases. The Base image is suitable for anyone who wants to run Fedora in the AWS public cloud or in a private cloud like OpenStack. It can be customized to fit your needs by adding additional packages. The Atomic image is generated using rpm-ostree tools to allow true "atomic" updates and is optimized to run Docker containers.
Both are available either to download in several formats or to launch in public clouds.

GPG keys
GPG keys used to sign packages
GPG keys used by Fedora Project
How does Fedora Project use GPG keys to sign packages?
Each stable RPM package that is published by Fedora Project is signed with a GPG signature.  By default yum and the graphical update tools will verify these signatures and refuse to install any packages that are not signed or have bad signatures.  You should always verify the signature of a package before you install it.  These signatures ensure that the packages you install are what was produced by the Fedora Project and have not been altered (accidentally or maliciously) by any mirror or website that is providing the packages.

If my friends and/or co-workers don't use Fedora for their design work will I still be able to collaborate with them?
Absolutely. I collaborate with designers that use the Adobe tools on OS X often. The free software creative tools in Fedora all support open standards in file formats and as far as I'm aware all of the major proprietary tools designers use can open these formats - PNG SVG PDF etc.

1. Keep daily and master To-Do lists
You may have read some personal organization books like Gettings Things Done by David Allen that advocate keeping lists of all the tasks you've got on your plate. One problem I've experienced using the system advocated in Getting Things Done is that you end up with a few very long lists that can be really de-motivating to look at - all that stuff in a big long list can be overwhelming.
Using Gnote however you can store a comprehensive (and long) 'To-Do' master list a full 'Waiting On' list of tasks you're waiting on other folks to follow up on and a 'Someday' or 'Tickler' list of tasks you'd like to do someday - and you can also store daily 'To-Do' lists that break off a very small digestible chunk of your longer master lists. This can be a whole lot less de-motivating because you're accomplishing tasks off of your separately-stored master list but in a way that shelters you from the overwhelming amount of tasks you haven't slated to work on today!

The file for the system-wide client configuration is located at /etc/ssh/sshconfig. Open it with your favorite text editor to see the available options. Changes to this file are not necessary for most common uses of ssh and its server component sshd; however to change an option either comment out the option (with a '#' symbol at the front of the line) to disable the option or remove the '#' symbol at the start of the line and add an argument to enable the option to your specification.
The sshconfig manual page (man sshconfig) contains all available options and the effect they have on the system.
Connection Example
This section provides an example of connecting to a remote host via the ssh command. Line numbers have been added here to help explain the actions taken.
Line 1 shows that the user1 user on the client system is initiating an SSH connection to a server with the ssh command. The server's domain name is foo.example.com but its IP address (10.0.0.1) could be used instead.

Internal error. Could not remove user.
krb5rcachedir (string)
This option accepts a special value LIBKRB5DEFAULTS that will instruct SSSD to let libkrb5 decide the appropriate location for the replay cache.
Default Distribution-specific and specified at build-time. (LIBKRB5DEFAULTS if not configured)
defaultdomainsuffix (string)
This string will be used as a default domain name for all names without a domain name component. The main use case is environments where the primary domain is intended for managing host policies and all users are located in a trusted domain.  The option allows those users to log in just with their user name without giving a domain name as well.
Default FALSE
While the first enumeration is running requests for the complete user or group lists may return no results until it completes.
Further enabling enumeration may increase the time necessary to detect network disconnection as longer timeouts are required to ensure that enumeration lookups are completed successfully.  For more information refer to the man pages for the specific idprovider in use.

sssd-ldap
SSSD LDAP provider
This manual page describes the configuration of LDAP domains for  sssd 8 .  Refer to the FILE FORMAT section of the  sssd.conf 5  manual page for detailed syntax information.
You can configure SSSD to use more than one LDAP domain.
LDAP back end supports id auth access and chpass providers. If you want to authenticate against an LDAP server either TLS/SSL or LDAPS is required. sssd does not support authentication over an unencrypted channel.  If the LDAP server is used only as an identity provider an encrypted channel is not needed. Please refer to ldapaccessfilter config option for more information about using LDAP as an access provider.
The LDAP attribute that corresponds to the user's full name.
Default cn
ldapusermemberof (string)
The LDAP attribute that lists the user's group memberships.
Default memberOf
none - No evaluation on the client side. This option cannot disable server-side password policies.
mitkerberos - Use the attributes used by MIT Kerberos to determine if the password has expired. Use chpassprovider=krb5 to update these attributes when the password is changed.
ldapreferrals (boolean)
Specifies whether automatic referral chasing should be enabled.
Please note that sssd only supports referral chasing when it is compiled with OpenLDAP version 2.4.13 or higher.
ignoreauthinfounavail
Specifies that the PAM module should return PAMIGNORE if it cannot contact the SSSD daemon. This causes the PAM framework to ignore this module.
Allows the administrator to restrict the domains a particular PAM service is allowed to authenticate against. The format is a comma-separated list of SSSD domain names as specified in the sssd.conf file.
NOTE Must be used in conjunction with the pamtrustedusers and pampublicdomains options.  Please see the  sssd.conf 5  manual page for more information on these two PAM responder options.

These options can be used to configure the InfoPipe responder.
Specifies the comma-separated list of UID values or user names that are allowed to access the InfoPipe responder. User names are resolved to UIDs at startup.
Default 0 (only the root user is allowed to access the InfoPipe responder)
Please note that although the UID 0 is used as the default it will be overwritten with this option. If you still want to allow the root user to access the InfoPipe responder which would be the typical case you have to add 0 to the list of allowed UIDs as well.
userattributes (string)
adgpomappermit = +mypamservice -sudo
systemd-user
adgpomapdeny = +mypamservice
krb5mapuser (string)
Please note that each SSSD service logs into its own log file. Also please note that enabling debuglevel in the [sssd] section only enables debugging just for the sssd process itself not for the responder or provider processes. The debuglevel parameter should be added to all sections that you wish to produce debug logs from.

Parameter Problem
Virtual Machine Management
Enable this option if you want to allow remote virtual machine management with SASL authentication and encryption (digest-md5 passwords or GSSAPI/Kerberos). The libvirtd service is needed for this option to be useful.
Virtual Machine Management (TLS)
Enable this option if you want to allow remote virtual machine management with TLS encryption x509 certificates and optional SASL authentication. The libvirtd service is needed for this option to be useful.
A firewall protects against unauthorized network intrusions. Enabling a firewall blocks all incoming connections. Disabling a firewall allows all connections and is not recommended.

GIMP History
Started with GIMP version 2.6 all tools rendering on canvas is now completely ported to . It provides smooth antialiased graphics and improves GIMP look. Some plug-ins have been upgraded to Cairo as well. Additionally all tools now use an on-canvas progress indicator instead of the one in the statusbar.
License change
The GIMP license has been changed to (L)GPLv3+.
New script API
A lot of GIMP APIs have been rebuilt to simplify developing new scripts.
When running ./autogen.sh you can notice some not found packages for example checking for dblatex no. Most of them are related to PDF files and you have to install them before running ./autogen.sh again if you want to create PDF files.

Ability to scroll beyond image border
The Navigation dialog now allows panning beyond the image border; so it is no longer a problem to use a brush on the edge of an image that fills the entire display window. Also if a utility window covers the image you can pan the image to view or edit the portion covered by the utility window.

Unlike previous versions of GIMP regardless of whether you're using a bitmap brush parametric brush or even a picture tube (multiple bitmaps) you can easily set the brush size with either the tool options dock slider or an external device such as a MIDI slider or knob or a USB device like the Griffin Powermate.
The selection tools have been rewritten from scratch to allow resizing of existing selections. Additionally the rectangular selection tool includes a setting for creating rounded corners as this has been identified as a very common task among web designers.
Selection tools in GIMP 2.4
The learning curve for the tools has been flattened as the key functionality is available without obscure shortcuts that confused GIMP beginners. Most of the existing shortcuts still work but the functionality is either available through the tool options or made obsolete due to the interactive move and resize on canvas.
While the tools have been redesigned to make them easier to understand for the newbies all the former functionality is there. You can still constrain aspect ratios or specific sizes.
Now we compare with the Adjust letter spacing option of Text tool
The option applies to the whole text not only to the selected text. Blank spaces are added inside letters widths and letter widths are not respected.
You can also use Altarrow keys to change baseline offset and kerning.
Change color of selected text this command opens a color dialog where you choose a color for the selected text.
Clear style of selected text using this command you can get rid of all new settings you applied to the selected text.

Introduction to Layers
If instead of a file name you have a URI (i.e. a web address) for the image you can open it using the menu by choosing FileOpen Location from an image menu. This brings up a small dialog that allows you to enter (or paste) the URI.
The Open Location dialog
The Open Location dialog.
The easiest way to open an image that was recently open in GIMP may be using FileOpen Recent. This displays a scrollable list of the mostly recently opened images with icons beside them. Select and open the desired image.
Using External Programs
Enlarged screenshots
Normal mode.
Dissolve mode.
Example for layer mode Multiply
Multiply mode multiplies the pixel values of the upper layer with those of the layer below it and then divides the result by 255. The result is usually a darker image. If either layer is white the resulting image is the same as the other layer (1 * I = I). If either layer is black the resulting image is completely black (0 * I = 0).
In QuickMask mode Cut and Paste act on the selection rather than the image. You can sometimes make use of this as the most convenient way of transferring a selection from one image to another.
You can learn more on Selection masks in the section dedicated to the channel dialog.
There are two QuickMask properties you can change by right-clicking on the QuickMask button.
Normally the QuickMask shows unselected areas fogged over  and selected areas in clear but you can reverse this by choosing Mask Selected Areas instead of the default Mask Unselected Areas.

For complex selections use SelectionFloating to create a floating selection. This creates a new layer with the selection called Floating Selection. Set the opacity slider in the Layer Dialog to the desired opacity. Then anchor the selection outside the selection the mouse pointer includes an anchor. When you click while the mouse pointer includes the anchor the floating selection disappears from the Layer Dialog and the selection is at the right place and partially transparent (anchoring works this way only if a selection tool is activated  you can also use the Anchor Layer command in the context menu by right clicking on the selected layer in the layer dialog).
And if you use this function frequently CtrlC to copy the selection CtrlV to paste the clipboard as a floating selection and LayerNew Layer to turn the selection into a new layer. You can adjust the opacity before or after creating the new layer.
Another way use LayerMaskAdd Layer Mask to add a layer mask to the layer with the selection initializing it with the selection. Then use a brush with the desired opacity to paint the selection with black i.e. paint it with transparency. Then Layer/Mask/Apply Layer Mask. See .
To make the solid background of an image transparent add an Alpha channel and use the Magic Wand to select the background. Then use the Color Picker tool to select the background color which becomes the foreground color in Toolbox. Use the Bucket Fill tool with the selected color. Set the Bucket Fill mode to Color Erase which erases pixels with the selected color; other pixels are partially erased and their color is changed.
The simplest method is to use EditClear which gives complete transparency to a selection.
In single-window mode the dialog is automatically docked to the Layers-Undo dock as a tab.
Use WindowsDockable Dialogs to view a list of dockable dialogs. Select a dockable dialog from the list to view the dialog. If the dialog is available in a dock then it is made visible. If the dialog is not in a dock the behavior is different in multi and single window modes 
either in the tab bar of a dock to integrate it in the dialog group
or on a docking bar that appears as a blue line when the mouse pointer goes over a dock border to anchor the dialog to the dock.
You can click-and-drag a tab and drop it in the wanted place 
When the image is displayed GIMP puts these components together to form the pixel colors for the screen printer or other output device. Some output devices may use different channels from Red Green and Blue. If they do GIMP's channels are converted into the appropriate ones for the device when the image is displayed.
Channels can be useful when you are working on an image which needs adjustment in one particular color. For example if you want to remove red eye from a photograph you might work on the Red channel.
You can look at channels as masks which allow or restrict the output of the color that the channel represents. By using Filters on the channel information you can create many varied and subtle effects on an image. A simple example of using a Filter on the color channels is the Channel Mixer filter.
In addition to these channels GIMP also allows you to create other channels (or more correctly Channel Masks) which are displayed in the lower part of the Channels dialog. You can create a New Channel or save a selection to a channel (mask). See the glossary entry on Masks for more information about Channel Masks.
A large component of learning how to use GIMP effectively is acquiring the art of making good selections—selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important GIMP provides many tools for doing it an assortment of selection-making tools a menu of selection operations and the ability to switch to Quick Mask mode in which you can treat the selection channel as though it were a color channel thereby painting the selection.
The hand representing the mouse pointer must turn smaller before releasing the mouse button.
A thin horizontal line marks where the layer will be laid down.
You can add existing layers to a layer group by click-and-dragging them. 
To add a new layer to the current layer group click on the Create a new layer at the bottom of the layer dialog or use the New Layer command in the image menu.
When a layer group is not empty a small gt; icon appears. By clicking on it you can fold/unfold the layer list. 
Here is clearly a practical use for scripts. By creating a script for making custom text logos buttons arrows etc. for your web site you will give them all the same style and shape. You will also be saving a lot of time because you don't have to create every logo text or button by hand.
Most of the scripts are quite self-explanatory but here are some hints
Leave all strange characters like ' and " intact.
Make sure that the pattern specified in the script exists.
Padding refers to the amount of space around your text.

The Import Palette dialog
Import Palette allows you to create a new palette from the colors in a gradient an image or a palette file. Choosing it brings up the Import Palette dialog which gives you the following options
Former versions of GIMP had a Save palette command. It no longer exists. To save the palette of an image indexed or not you must import it in fact from the image.
You can import a palette either from any of GIMP's gradients (choosing one from the adjoining menu) or from any of the currently open images (chosen from the adjoining menu). Since GIMP 2.2 you can also import a RIFF palette file (with extension .pal) of the type used by several Microsoft Windows applications.
Two options concerning image as source available for RGB images only
With GIMP-2.8 tool presets are saved in a new format (.gtp). To use your 2.6 presets you have to convert them using  until it is included in GIMP.
At the bottom of the dialog appear four buttons 
The Tool Presets Dialog Context Menu
Duplicate Tool Preset this command is always disabled. It is not necessary since as we saw above a duplicate is automatically created when you create a new preset from an existing preset.
Copy Tool Preset Location this command copies the path to the tool preset file into clipboard.
From the Tool Options dialog of the Clone tool and the Bucket Fill tool by clicking on the pattern source button you get a pop-up with similar functionality that permits you to quickly choose a pattern from the list; if you clic on the Bucket Fill button present on the right bottom of the pop-up you open the real pattern dialog. Note that depending on your Preferences a pattern selected with the pop-up may only apply to the currently active tool not to other paint tools. See the  Tool Option Preferences  section for more information.
Using the pattern dialog
In the Tab menu you can choose between View as Grid and View as List. In Grid mode the patterns are laid out in a rectangular array making it easy to see many at once and find the one you are looking for. In List mode the patterns are lined up in a list with the names beside them.
Independent of the real size of a pattern all patterns are shown the same size in the dialog. So for larger patterns this means that you see only a small portion of the pattern in the dialog at all - no matter whether you view the dialog in the list or the grid view. To see the full pattern you simply click on the pattern and hold the mouse button for a second.
In the Tab menu the option Preview Size allows you to adapt the size of pattern previews to your liking.
Triangle Color Selector
The triangle selector
This selector uses the  color model. Click in the chromatic circle and drag the mouse pointer to select the Hue. Click-and-drag in the triangle to vary intuitively Saturation (vertically) and Value (horizontally).
Watercolor Color Selector
This color selector is symbolized by a brush. The function mode of this selector is a little different from that of models presented so far. The principle consists in changing the current foreground color by clicking in the rectangular palette. If the current foreground color is for example white then it turns to reddish by clicking in the red color area. Repeated clicking strengthens the effect. With the slider which is right apart from the color palette you can set the color quantity per every mouse click. The higher the sliding control is the more color is taken up per click.
These options give you a number of alternative ways of assigning colors to the endpoints. From the submenu you can choose (assuming we're dealing with the left endpoint)
This choice will cause the color of the right endpoint of the segment neighboring on the left to be assigned to the left endpoint of the selected range.
This choice will cause the color of the right endpoint of the selected range to be assigned to the left endpoint.
FG/BG color
This choice causes GIMP's current foreground or background color as shown in the Toolbox to be assigned to the endpoint. Note that changing foreground or background color later will not change the endpoint's color.
Save all errors
This button lets you save the whole log. You can also select a part of the log (by click-and-dragging the mouse pointer or by using the Shiftarrow keys key combination) and save only this selected part by pressing the Shift key.
A dialog window Save Error Log to File lets you choose the name and the destination directory of this file

The Frosty logo
This filter is derived from the Frosty logo script (FileCreateLogosFrosty in the image window) which creates a frozen logo like the example above.
The filter adds this frosty effect to the alpha that is the area of the active layer defined by the non-transparent pixels (think of it as a selection by visibility). The filter effect will always be applied according to the alpha values.
Unlike the most alpha to logo filters the Frosty filter will not resize the image to the active layer's size.

Edge detect filters search for borders between different colors and so can detect contours of objects.
They are used to make selections and for many artistic purposes.
Most of them are based on gradient calculation methods and give thick border lines. Look at fig.1 which represents color intensity variations. On the left is a slow color gradient which is not a border. On the right is a quick variation which is an edge. Now let us calculate the gradient the variation speed of this edge i.e. the first derivative (fig.2). We have to decide that a border is detected when gradient is more than a threshold value (the exact border is at top of the curve but this top varies according to borders). In most cases threshold is under top and border is thick.

Images captured by videocards especially when fast movement is recorded may look blurred and stripped with split objects. This is due to how cameras work. They don't record 25 images per second but 50 with half vertical resolution. There are two interlaced images in one frame. First line of first image is followed by first line of second image followed by second line of first image etc. So if there have been an important move between the two images objects will appear split shifted stripped.
The Deinterlace filter keeps only one of both images and replaces missing lines by a gradient between previous and following lines. The resulting image or selection will be somewhat blurred but can be improved by enhance filters
What is a convolution matrix? It's possible to get a rough idea of it without using mathematical tools that only a few ones know. Convolution is the treatment of a matrix by another one which is called kernel.
The Convolution Matrix filter uses a first matrix which is the Image to be treated. The image is a bi-dimensional collection of pixels in rectangular coordinates. The used kernel depends on the effect you want.
GIMP uses 5x5 or 3x3 matrices. We will consider only 3x3 matrices they are the most used and they are enough for all effects you want. If all border values of a kernel are set to zero then system will consider it as a 3x3 matrix.
The filter studies successively every pixel of the image. For each of them which we will call the initial pixel it multiplies the value of this pixel and values of the 8 surrounding pixels by the kernel corresponding value. Then it adds the results and the initial pixel is set to this final result value.

An Alpha value indicates the transparency of a pixel. Besides its Red Green and Blue values a pixel has an alpha value. The smaller the alpha value of a pixel the more visible the colors below it. A pixel with an alpha value of 0 is completely transparent. A pixel with an alpha value of 255 is fully opaque.
With some image file formats you can only specify that a pixel is completely transparent or completely opaque. Other file formats allow a variable level of transparency.
GIF was introduced by CompuServe in 1987. It became popular mostly because of its efficient LZW compression. The size of the image files required clearly less disk space than other usual graphics formats of the time such as PCX or MacPaint. Even large images could be transmitted in a reasonable time even with slow modems. In addition the open licensing policy of CompuServe made it possible for any programmer to implement the GIF format for his own applications free of charge as long as the CompuServe copyright notice was attached to them.
Colors in GIF are stored in a color table which can hold up to 256 different entries chosen from 16.7 million different color values. When the image format was introduced this was not a much of a limitation since only a few people had hardware which could display more colors than that. For typical drawings cartoons black-and-white photographs and similar uses 256 colors are quite sufficient as a rule even today. For more complex images such as color photographs however a huge loss of quality is apparent which is why the format is not considered to be suitable for those purposes.
One color entry in the palette can be defined to be transparent. With transparency the GIF image can look like it is non-rectangular in shape. However semi-transparency as in PNG is not possible. A pixel can only be either entirely visible or completely transparent.
The first version of GIF was 87a. In 1989 CompuServe published an expanded version called 89a. Among other things this made it possible to save several images in one GIF file which is especially used for simple animation. The version number can be distinguished from the first six bytes of a GIF file. Interpreted as ASCII symbols they are GIF87a or GIF89a.
GNU
One way to reduce quantization effects is to use Dithering. The operations in GIMP which perform dithering are the Gradient tool (if you have enabled the dithering option) and the Convert to Indexed command. However they only work on RGB images and not on Indexed images.
Rendering Intent
Rendering intents are ways of dealing with colors that are out-of- colors present in the source space that the destination space is incapable of producing. There are four rendering intents defined by the ICC
This rendering intent is typically used for photographic content. It scales one gamut to fit into the other while maintaining the relative position of colors.
This rendering intent is typically used for spot colors. Colors that are not out of gamut are left unchanged. Colors outside the gamut are converted to colors with the same lightness but different saturation at the edge of the gamut.
Moreover if you always need alpha in your layers you can enable automatic generation of the alpha channel in imported images upon opening them. See EditPreferencesImage Import amp; Export page for this and more policies.
Layer groups can finally have masks on

Here are examples of the results of these commands all together on one page so you can compare them more easily. The most appropriate command depends upon your image so you should try each of them to see which command works best on it.
The original layer and its histograms
This layer doesn't have any very bright or very dark pixels so it works well with these commands.
The Equalize command
Equalize example
The slider and the small arrow buttons allow you to select a hue in the color circle (-180° 180°).
Chroma is the purity of the color. Moving this slider makes colors more or less pure.
This slider and the small arrow buttons allow you to select a value (luminosity) -100 100.
Colors to Gray
The Equalize command automatically adjusts the brightness of colors across the active layer so that the histogram for the Value channel is as nearly flat as possible that is so that each possible brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as every other value. You can see this in the histograms in the example below in that pixel colors which occur frequently in the image are stretched further apart than pixel colors which occur only rarely. The results of this command can vary quite a bit. Sometimes Equalize works very well to enhance the contrast in an image bringing out details which were hard to see before. Other times the results look very bad. It is a very powerful operation and it is worth trying to see if it will improve your image. It works on layers from RGB and Grayscale images. If the image is Indexed the menu entry is insensitive and grayed out.
Decomposed image (RGB decomposition)
Compose applied
This command constructs an image from several grayscale images or layers for instance from extracted RGB HSV components. You can also build an image from grayscale images or layers created independently.
You can find this command in the image window menu under ColorsComponentsCompose. It is enabled if your image is grayscale.

Clicking on the boxes in the first column of the modules list will check or uncheck the modules. The next time you start GIMP any checked module will be loaded.
You will notice the difference only when you try to use the modules. For example there are several color selectors to select the foreground or background color. Some of these selectors are modules and will only be available when you check the respective option in the module manager

This button shows All Images by default. This means that all images will be displayed in the middle panel whatever their file type. By developing this list you can choose to show only one type of file.
At Select File Type you can select a compressed format for your XCF file.
The Create Template command opens the Create New Template dialog that allows you to create a template with the same dimensions and color space as the current image. A dialog pops up which asks you to name the new template. Then the template is saved and becomes available in the New Image dialog. If you give a name that already exists GIMP generates a unique name by appending a number to it. You can use the Templates dialog to modify or delete templates.
You can access this command from the image menu through FileCreate Template. There is no default keyboard shortcut.
This command is called Export for a native XCF file. Then it does the same thing as Export As. At early GIMP 2.8 releases this menu label was Export to. Since the version 2.8.10 Export to and Export have been renamed to Export and Export As after the manner of Save and Save As.

Delete selections
The Float command converts a normal selection into a floating selection.
A floating selection (sometimes called a floating layer) is a type of temporary layer which is similar in function to a normal layer except that before you can resume working on any other layers in the image a floating selection must be anchored. That is you have to attach it to a normal (non-floating) layer usually the original layer (the one which was active previously) for instance by clicking on the image outside of the floating selection (see below).
You cannot perform any operations on other layers while the image has a floating selection!
You can use various operations to change the image data on the floating selection. There can only be one floating selection in an image at a time.
If you display the layer boundary by using the Show Layer Boundary command you may have difficulty selecting a precise area of the image which you want in a layer. To avoid this problem you can make a rectangular selection transform it into a floating selection and anchor it to a new layer. Then simply remove the original layer.
You can access this command from the image menubar through ViewDot for Dot.
Snap to Canvas
Snap to canvas
If this option is enabled when you move a selection or a layer they appear to pull on the canvas edges when it approaches. This is useful for accurate placement of image elements.
Canvas edges are usually mingled with image edges the canvas has then the same size as the image. But you can change canvas size in ImageCanvas Size.

The Tool Icons in the Toolbox
Most tools can be activated by clicking on an icon in the Toolbox. By default some tools are accessible only via the menus (namely the Color tools are accessible only either as Colors or as ToolsColors). Every tool in fact can be activated from the Tools menu; also every tool can be activated from the keyboard using an accelerator key.
In the default setup created when GIMP is first installed not all tools show icons in the Toolbox the Color tools are omitted. You can customize the set of tools that are shown in the Toolbox through EditPreferencesToolbox. There are two reasons you might want to do this first if you only rarely use a tool it might be easier to find the tools you want if the distracting icon is removed; second if you use the Color tools a lot you might find it convenient to have icons for them easily available. In any case regardless of the Toolbox you can always access any tool at any time using the Tools menu from an image menubar.
The shape of the cursor changes when it is inside an image to one that indicates which tool is active (if in Preferences you have set Image WindowsMouse PointersPointer modeTool icon).

Adding a new subpath When you press Ctrl and hover the mouse pointer outside the existing path the mouse pointer starts displaying a square. Clicking will start a subpath that isn't connected to other curves but is considered a part of the path.
Edit performs functions which are not available in Design mode. With this mode you can work only on the existing path. Outside the pointer is a small crossed circle (on the whole image if there is no path!) and you can do nothing.
Add a segment between two nodes Click on a node at one end of the path to activate it. The pointer is like a union symbol. Click on an other node to link both nodes. This is useful when you have to link unclosed components.
Remove a segment from a path While pressing ShiftCtrl key combination point to a segment. Pointer turns to -. Click to delete the segment.

Pencil tool
The Pencil tool is used to draw free hand lines with a hard edge. The pencil and paintbrush are similar tools. The main difference between the two tools is that although both use the same type of brush the pencil tool will not produce fuzzy edges even with a very fuzzy brush. It does not even do anti-aliasing.
Why would you want to work with such a crude tool? Perhaps the most important usage is when working with very small images such as icons where you operate at a high zoom level and need to get every pixel exactly right. With the pencil tool you can be confident that every pixel within the brush outline will be changed in exactly the way you expect.
If you want to draw straight lines with the Pencil (or any of several other paint tools) click at the starting point then hold down Shift and click at the ending point.

After creating and modifying the selection you will have to exit this editing mode (and commit any changes). You can do this with a single click inside the selection or by pressing the Enter key. Or you can just use a non-selection tool and for example fill or paint the selection.
Tool Options for the Rectangle Select tool
If you enable this option a slider appears. You can use this to adjust the radius that is used to round the corners of the selection.
If you enable this option the point the selection is started by pressing the mouse button is used as center of the selected area.
This is a drop down list where you select the type of guide lines which suits your transforming. All the guides uses a frame to mark the image's outline in addition to the lines used by the different selections.
As the name tells you there are no guides used.
Uses one vertical line and one horizontal line crossing each other in the center of the image or layer.
Divides the transforming area in nine equal parts by adding two horizontal lines and two vertical lines equally spaced. According to this rule the most interesting parts of the image should be placed at the intersection points.
Just as the Rules of thirds but divides the area in five by five parts.
The Move tool allows to move the selection outline only. If the Move Mode is Layer you must hold down CtrlAlt keys.
If the Move Mode is Selection you can click-and-drag any point in canvas to move the selection outline. You can also use the arrow keys to move selections precisely. Then holding down the  Shift key moves then by increments of 25 pixels.
When you move a selection with the Move tool the center of the selection is marked with a small cross. This cross and selection boundaries snap to guides or grid if the ViewSnap to Guides (or Grid) option is checked this makes aligning selections easier.

To add a new brush after either creating or downloading it you need to save it in a format GIMP can use. The brush file needs to be placed in the GIMP's brush search path so that GIMP is able to index and display it in the Brushes dialog. You can hit the Refresh button which reindexes the brush directory. GIMP uses three file formats for brushes
GBR
The .gbr ("gimp brush") format is used for ordinary and color brushes. You can convert many other types of images including many brushes used by other programs into GIMP brushes by opening them in GIMP and saving them with file names ending in .gbr. This brings up a dialog box in which you can set the default Spacing for the brush. A more complete description of the GBR file format can be found in the file gbr.txt in the devel-docs directory of the GIMP source distribution.
Save a .gbr brush
GIH
JPEG is a very good compression algorithm but lossy.
CCITT Group 3 fax; CCITT Group 4 fax is a black and white format developed to transfer images by FAX.
These options can only be selected if the image is in indexed mode and reduced to two colors. Use ImageModeIndexed to convert the image to indexed. Be certain to check Use black and white (1-bit) palette.
With this option the color values are saved even if the pixels are completely transparent.
In this text box you can enter a comment that is associated with the image.
SF-OPTION "label" '("option1" "option2")
The value returned when the script is invoked is the number of the chosen option where the option first is counted as 0.
SF-ENUM
It will create a widget in the control dialog. The widget is a combo-box showing all enum values for the given enum type. This has to be the name of a registered enum without the "Gimp" prefix. The second parameter speficies the default value using the enum value's nick.
SF-ENUM "Interpolation" '("InterpolationType" "linear")
Knowing that the + operator can take a list of numbers to add you might be tempted to convert the above to the following
(+ 3 (5 6) 7)
However this is incorrect mdash; remember every statement in Scheme starts and ends with parens so the Scheme interpreter will think that you're trying to call a function named 5 in the second group of parens rather than summing those numbers before adding them to 3.
The correct way to write the above statement would be
(+ 3 (+ 5 6) 7)
Your First Script-Fu Script
Do you not need to stop and catch your breath? No? Well then let's proceed with your fourth lesson mdash; your first Script-Fu Script.
Creating A Text Box Script
One of the most common operations I perform in GIMP is creating a box with some text in it for a web page a logo or whatever. However you never quite know how big to make the initial image when you start out. You don't know how much space the text will fill with the font and font size you want.
The Script-Fu Master (and student) will quickly realize that this problem can easily be solved and automated with Script-Fu.
Currently the image is resized to fit exactly around the text mdash; there's no room for anything like drop shadows or special effects (even though many scripts will automatically resize the image as necessary). Let's add a buffer around the text and even let the user specify how much buffer to add as a percentage of the size of the resultant text.
This script could easily be used in other scripts that work with text. Let's extend it so that it returns the image and the layers so other scripts can call this script and use the image and layers we create.
Modifying The Parameters And The Registration Function
To let the user specify the amount of buffer we'll add a parameter to our function and the registration function
Adding The New Code
Another tool looking very much as the clone tool but smarter is the healing tool which also takes the area around the destination into account when cloning. A typical usage is removal of wrinkles and other minor errors in images.
In some cases you may be able to get good results by simply cutting out the offending object from the image and then using a plug-in called Resynthesizer to fill in the void. This plug-in is not included with the main GIMP distribution but it can be obtained from the author's web site . As with many things your mileage may vary.
Removing Red-eye
Red-eyes
When you take a flash picture of somebody who is looking directly toward the camera the iris of the eye can bounce the light of the flash back toward the camera in such a way as to make the eye appear bright red this effect is called red eye and looks very bizarre. Many modern cameras have special flash modes that minimize red-eye but they only work if you use them and even then they don't always work perfectly. Interestingly the same effect occurs with animals but the eyes may show up as other colors such as green.
Using Quick Mask
Activate QuickMask mode using the left-bottom button in the image window. If a selection is present the mask is initialized with the content of the selection.
Choose any drawing tool. Paint on the QuickMask with black to remove selected areas and paint with white to add selected areas. Use grey colors to partially select areas.
You can also use selection tools and fill these selections with the Bucket Fill tool; this does not destroy the QuickMask selections!
Toggle QuickMask mode off using the left-bottom button in the image window the selection will be displayed with marching ants.
This tells how cells have been arranged in layers. If for example you have placed height cells at the rate of two cells per layer on four layers GIMP will display 1 rows of 2 columns on each layer.
Dimension Ranks Selection
There things are getting complicated! Explanations are necessary to understand how to arrange cell and layers.
GIMP starts retrieving cells from each layer and stacks them into a FIFO stack (First In First Out the first in is at the top of the stack and so can be first out). In our example 4 layers with 2 cells in each we'll have from top to bottom first cell of first layer second cell of first layer first cell of second layer second cell of second layer second cell of fourth layer. With one cell per layer or with several cells per layer result is the same. You can see this stack in the Layer Dialog of the resulting .gih image file.
Then GIMP creates a computer array from this stack with the Dimensions you have set. You can use four dimensions.

Please note that the GIMP color management is used to enhance the display of images and the embedding of profiles to image files only. Especially are the options you choose in this dialog in no way used for printing from within GIMP. This is because the printing is a special task done by a more specialized printing engine that is no part of GIMP.

Here you choose which option to use. Because the help pages were carefully checked to make sure they work well with GIMP's browser whereas other web browsers are somewhat variable in their support of features the safer option is to use the internal browser; but really any modern web browser should be okay.
Note that the GIMP help browser is not available on all platforms. If it is missing this option is hidden and the standard web browser will be used to read the help pages.

Using the Reply To All Feature
Susan sends an email to a client and sends copies to Tim and to an internal company mailing list of co-workers. If Tim wants to make a comment for all of them to read he uses Reply to All but if he just wants to tell Susan that he agrees with her he uses Reply. His reply does not reach anyone that Susan put on her Bcc list because that list is not shared with anyone.
If you subscribe to a mailing list and want your reply to go just to the list rather than to the sender select Reply to List instead of Reply or Reply to All.

GDM uses syslog to log errors and status. It can also log debugging information which can be useful for tracking down problems if GDM is not working properly. Debug output can be enabled by setting the debug/Enable key to "true" in the lt;etcgt;/gdm/custom.conf file.
Output from the various Xservers is stored in the GDM log directory which is normally lt;vargt;/log/gdm/. Any Xserver messages are saved to a file associated with the display value lt;displaygt;.log.
The session output is piped through the GDM daemon to the /$XDGCACHEHOME/gdm/session.log file which usually expands to /.cache/gdm/session.log. The file is overwritten on each login so logging out and logging back into the same user via GDM will cause any messages from the previous session to be lost.
Note that if GDM can not create this file for some reason then a fallback file will be created named /$XDGCACHEHOME/gdm/session.log.XXXXXXXX where the XXXXXXXX are some random characters.

Save and resume
If you are replacing an existing profile in Windows XP the above shortcut does not work. The profiles must be manually copied to C\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color for the original profile to be replaced.
Windows XP requires a program to be run at startup to copy the profile calibration curves into the video card. This can be done using Adobe Gamma LUT Loader or by using the free  Microsoft Color Control Panel Applet. Using the latter adds a new Color item to the control panel and allows the calibration curves from default profile to be easily set at each startup.
Windows Vista
Microsoft Windows Vista mistakenly removes calibration curves from the video LUT after logon after suspend and when the UAC screen appears. This means you may have to manually reload the ICC profile calibration curves. If you are using profiles with embedded calibration curves you have to be very careful the calibration state has not been cleared.
Windows 7
Turn on bounce keys to ignore key presses that are rapidly repeated. For example if you have hand tremors which cause you to press a key multiple times when you only want to press it once you should turn on bounce keys.
Open the Activities overview and start typing Settings.
Click Universal Access in the sidebar to open the panel.
Press Typing Assist (AccessX) in the Typing section.
Switch the Bounce Keys switch to on.
Sticky keys allows you to type keyboard shortcuts one key at a time rather than having to hold down all of the keys at once. For example the SuperTab shortcut switches between windows. Without sticky keys turned on you would have to hold down both keys at the same time; with sticky keys turned on you would press Super and then Tab to do the same.
You might want to turn on sticky keys if you find it difficult to hold down several keys at once.
Switch the Sticky Keys switch to on.
Quickly turn sticky keys on and off
Under Enable by Keyboard select Turn on accessibility features from the keyboard to turn sticky keys on and off from the keyboard. When this option is selected you can press Shift five times in a row to enable or disable sticky keys.

Screens change all the time the backlight in a TFT display will halve in brightness approximately every 18 months and will get yellower as it gets older. This means you should recalibrate your screen when the [!] icon appears in the Color panel.
LED screens also change over time but a much slower rate than TFTs.
Calibration and characterization are different things entirely.
What’s the difference between calibration and characterization?
Many people are initially confused about the difference between calibration and characterization. Calibration is the process of modifying the color behavior of a device. This is typically done using two mechanisms
Bigger steps mean a larger error between the captured color and the stored color and for some colors this is a big problem. It turns out that key colors like skin colors are very important and even small errors will make untrained viewers notice that something in a photograph looks wrong.
Of course using a 16 bit image is going to leave many more steps and a much smaller quantization error but this doubles the size of each image file. Most content in existence today is 8bpp i.e. 8 bits-per-pixel.
Color management is a process for converting from one color space to another where a color space can be a well known defined space like sRGB or a custom space such as your monitor or printer profile.
Calibrating is important if you care about the colors you display or print.
Why do I need to do calibration myself?

How to check why your mouse is not working.
Mouse pointer is not moving
Check that the mouse is plugged in
If you have a mouse with a cable check that it is firmly plugged in to your computer.
If it is a USB mouse (with a rectangular connector) try plugging it in to a different USB port. If it is a PS/2 mouse (with a small round connector with six pins) make sure that it is plugged in to the green mouse port rather than the purple keyboard port. You may need to restart the computer if it was not plugged in.
Browse files on a server or network share
You can connect to a server or network share to browse and view files on that server exactly as if they were on your own computer. This is a convenient way to download or upload files on the internet or to share files with other people on your local network.
To browse files over the network open the Files application from the Activities overview and click Other Locations in the sidebar. The file manager will find any computers on your local area network that advertise their ability to serve files. If you want to connect to a server on the internet or if you do not see the computer you’re looking for you can manually connect to a server by typing in its internet/network address.
Connect to a file server
In the file manager click Other Locations in the sidebar.
r readable meaning that you can open the file or folder
w writable meaning that you can save changes to it

You may need to install Flash to be able to view websites like YouTube which display videos and interactive web pages.
Install the Flash plug-in
Flash is a plug-in for your web browser that allows you to watch videos and use interactive web pages on some websites. Some websites won’t work without Flash.
If you do not have Flash installed you will probably see a message telling you so when you visit a website that needs it. Flash is available as a free (but not open-source) download for most web browsers. Most Linux distributions have a version of Flash that you can install through their software installer (package manager) too.
If Flash is available from the software installer
If you are connected to the internet by wireless (Wi-Fi) check the network icon on the top bar to see if you have good wireless signal. If not the internet may be slow because you don’t have a very strong signal.
Using a slower mobile internet connection
If you have a mobile internet connection and notice that it is slow you may have moved into an area where signal reception is poor. When this happens the internet connection will automatically switch from a fast “mobile broadband” connection like 3G to a more reliable but slower connection like GPRS.
Web browser has a problem
Sometimes web browsers encounter a problem that makes them run slow. This could be for any number of reasons — you could have visited a website that the browser struggled to load or you might have had the browser open for a long time for example. Try closing all of the browser’s windows and then opening the browser again to see if this makes a difference.
Sometimes wireless cards get stuck or experience a minor problem that means they won’t connect. Try turning the card off and then on again to reset it — see  for more information.
Check that you’re using the correct type of wireless security
When prompted for your wireless security password you can choose which type of wireless security to use. Make sure you choose the one that is used by the router or wireless base station. This should be selected by default but sometimes it will not be for some reason. If you don’t know which one it is use trial and error to go through the different options.
Check that your wireless card is properly supported
Some wireless cards aren’t supported very well. They show up as a wireless connection but they can’t connect to a network because their drivers lack the ability to do this. See if you can get an alternative wireless driver or if you need to perform some extra set-up (like installing a different firmware). See  for more information.
Enable automatic brightness
If your computer has an integrated light sensor it can be used to automatically control screen brightness. This ensures that the screen is always easy to see in different ambient light conditions and helps to reduce battery consumption.
In the Power Saving section ensure that the Automatic brightness switch is set to on.
To disable automatic screen brightness switch it to off.
Configure your computer to suspend automatically.
Why does my computer not turn back on after I suspended it?
If you suspend your computer then try to resume it you may find that it does not work as you expected. This could be because suspend is not supported properly by your hardware.
My computer is suspended and is not resuming
If you suspend your computer and then press a key or click the mouse it should wake up and display a screen asking for your password. If this does not happen try pressing the power button (do not hold it in just press it once).
If this still does not help make sure that your computer’s monitor is switched on and try pressing a key on the keyboard again.
Click Printers to open the panel.
Click the Show Jobs button on the right-hand side of the Printers dialog.
Cancel the print job by clicking the stop button.
If this does not cancel the print job like you expected try holding down the cancel button on your printer.
As a last resort especially if you have a big print job with a lot of pages that will not cancel remove the paper from the printer’s paper input tray. The printer should realize that there is no paper and will stop printing. You can then try canceling the print job again or try turning the printer off and then on again.

Click Language.
Select your desired region and language. If your region and language are not listed click  at the bottom of the list to select from all available regions and languages.
Some translations may be incomplete and certain applications may not support your language at all. Any untranslated text will appear in the language in which the software was originally developed usually American English.
There are some special folders in your home folder where applications can store things like music pictures and documents. These folders use standard names according to your language. When you log back in you will be asked if you want to rename these folders to the standard names for your selected language. If you plan to use the new language all the time you should update the folder names.
Change how long to wait before locking the screen in the Privacy settings.
Quickly running a command
Another way of launching an application is to press AltF2 enter its command name and then press the Enter key.
For example to launch Rhythmbox press AltF2 and type ‘rhythmbox’ (without the single-quotes). The name of the app is the command to launch the program.
Use the arrow keys to quickly access previously run commands.

A good method for choosing a password is to take the first letter of each word in a phrase that you can remember. The phrase could be the name of a movie a book a song or an album. For example “Flatland A Romance of Many Dimensions” would become FARoMD or faromd or f aromd.
Make your password as long as possible. The more characters it contains the longer it should take for a person or computer to guess it.
Do not use any words that appear in a standard dictionary in any language. Password crackers will try these first. The most common password is “password” — people can guess passwords like this very quickly!
Do not use any personal information such as a date license plate number or any family member’s name.
Do not use any nouns.
You can play your favorite music by creating a playlist or by simply clicking on the song of your choice from any view.

The donut order count does not depend on the number of donuts already eaten by a worm. If the game is in level 1 and if player 1 eats the first donut he scores 1 point if player 2 eats the second donut he scores 2 points; a third player may choose to not eat any donuts till the tenth donut and score 10 points at once.
The heart-shaped bonus   This bonus gives you an extra life and does not cause an increase in the length of your worm.
The number of lives remaining for a worm is given by the number on the left of the comma in a worm's score. If a worm's score is 10005 the worm has 10 lives remaining.
You cannot get extra lives by scoring 10000 points or more. If you have scored 12345 points with 10 lives remaining your score will be 1012345.
The diamond-shaped bonus   This bonus does not cause an increase in the length of the worm and does not give you any points. It causes a reversal in the movement of all the other worms in the game.

If you check the Use safe moves checkbox the game will prevent you from moving if the move would cause a robot to kill you unless the only way to survive is to teleport. If you check the Use super safe moves checkbox the game will prevent you from making any move in this case so that you are forced to teleport. This reduces the level of difficulty. You can always uncheck these if you find the game too easy.
 Robots
Robots is based on the UNIX command-line game of the same name. The aim of the game is to destroy all the robots by getting them to crash into each other or into junk heaps from previous collisions without them crashing into you.

A Clutter image viewer
Clutter
Clutter uses the OpenGL and OpenGL|ES industry standard API to access the accelerated graphical hardware on both desktop and mobile environments alike without exposing the complexities of GPU pipeline programming.
A number of third-party libraries allow integration with other technologies such as Clutter-GTK for embedding a Clutter stage inside a GTK+ application; Clutter-GStreamer for embedding GStreamer video and audio pipelines; Clutter-Box2D and Clutter-Bullet for adding physics interaction in both 2D and 3D environments.
The system bus is a single message bus which runs independently of any user sessions. It can communicate with applications in any session enabling those applications to interact with system components without dealing with low-level system details. The system bus is used to provide important functionality that users expect to work on their systems. For example the system bus is used to monitor when network interfaces go up or down when external drives get plugged in and when laptop batteries are low.
D-Bus is developed jointly on freedesktop.org so you can use it with different desktop environments and applications. Because D-Bus is a cross-desktop project you use it to create portable and versatile software that seamlessly integrates with the user's desktop regardless of which desktop it is.

Press Continue to finish creating the keyring. If you have not protected your keyring with a password you will need to confirm that this is how you want to proceed.
Your new keyring will now be listed under Passwords.
In the new dialog confirm the deletion by ticking the I understand that this secret key will be permanently deleted checkbox and press the Delete button to finish.
Advance or postpone the expiration date of your keys.
Change the expiration date of your keys
If your PGP key has expired but you wish to continue its use you can change its expiry date. You can also change the expiration settings to have a key expire on an earlier date.
To change the expiration date of a PGP key
Only PGP keys that have been published on a key server can be synchronized. If the Sync button is not clickable check if the key has been published on a key server. In the case of synchronizing your own keys publish them before synchronizing them.
Having many user IDs helps you to use the same key to communicate with different people.
Add extra user IDs to a key
A key can have multiple user IDs. This is helpful when you want to use the same key while communicating with several people and one of them does not recognize say the email address in your user ID. This person may not want to import your public key since it contains information that they do not know. In such scenarios if you do not want to create a new key with a different user ID you can attach a new user ID to your existing key.
To add an extra user ID
Press the Revoke button.
You will have to unlock the key with its passphrase.
The Status of the subkey changes to Revoked in the Subkeys panel.
If you have published your subkey you must synchronize it with the key servers after revoking it to apply the revocation on all copies of the key.
Using an Automatic Document Feeder
Custom default values for system settings
System-wide default settings can be set by providing a default for a key in a  profile. These defaults can be overridden by the user.
Set a default value
To set a default for a key the user profile must exist and the value for the key must be added to a  database.
Create the  profile
$ fc-cache /usr/local/share/fonts/
You may need to restart running applications to see the changes. User sessions do not need to be restarted.
Alternatively you can also install fonts in another system directory than /usr/local/share/fonts/ if that directory is listed in the /etc/fonts/fonts.conf file. If it is not then you need to create your own machine-wide configuration file in /etc/fonts/local.conf containing the directory you want to use. See the fonts-conf(5) man page for more information.
If you are using an alternative directory remember to specify the directory name when updating the font cache with the fc-cache command
$ fc-cache directoryname

How do I make it easy for different users to access different file shares?
Configure a default server list
Nautilus (the Files application) stores a list of file-sharing servers in the file /.config/nautilus/servers in the XBEL format. Add the list of file-sharing servers to that file to make file shares easily accessible to your user.

ORBit is a fast and lightweight CORBA server. GNOME's component architecture Bonobo is built on top of CORBA.
Bonobo-activation allows you to browse the available CORBA servers on your system (running or not). It keeps track of the running servers so that if you ask for a server which is already running you will not start it again but will reuse the already running one.
Bonobo is a framework for creating reusable components for use in GNOME applications built on top of CORBA.
The Bonobo UI library provides a number of user interface controls using the Bonobo component framework.

Dasher is like an arcade game `Attack of the killer alphabets' perhaps.
Dasher is a zooming interface. You point where you want to go and the display zooms in wherever you point. The world into which you are zooming is painted with letters so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text. The more you zoom in the longer the piece of text you have written. You choose what you write by choosing where to zoom.
To make the interface efficient we use the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text. Probable pieces of text are given more space so they are quick and easy to select. Improbable pieces of text (for example text with spelling mistakes) are given less space so they are harder to write. The language model learns all the time if you use a novel word once it is easier to write next time.
A big advantage of Dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces that offer word-completions to the user is that it is mode-free the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an accept-model-predictions mode.
To avoid difficulties with the mouse being bounded by the top and bottom of the screen we recommend choosing a window size for Dasher that is not full-screen in size. Place the Dasher window so that there is a margin above and below the Dasher canvas.
Technical note As well as through mouse emulation Dasher is able to receive tracking information from gaze trackers head trackers or similar systems directly by means of a system socket. This option can be configured in the 'Input Device' section of the 'preferences' dialogue.
Discrete Gestures
We have several versions of button Dasher available in Dasher Version 4.
Are time-critical gestures not an option?

Personal information
The Personal Information window requires you to supply personal information to use Ekiga. This information is displayed when connecting to other audio/video applications.
The Accounts window gives you a clear explanation of what accounts are for. You may simply skip it if you already know what an account is and what to use it for.
Ekiga.net Account
Ekiga uses a best-effort algorithm to maintain a low bandwidth when transmitting video. It will permit Ekiga to dynamically adjust the video bandwidth and the number of transmitted images per second during a call while trying to respect the requested video bandwidth.
Notice that the algorithm is a best-effort algorithm which means that if your video bandwidth settings are too low it can be impossible to respect them. However if the video bandwidth permits to transmit with a better quality or faster than the requested values then Ekiga will dynamically increase them so that the quality and the framerate are always the best possible.
Monitoring lines
Ekiga can connect to PBX systems supporting the SIP protocol. In that case it is able to indicate if the line associated with a user is in use or not. Please refer to the documentation of your PBX to enable that feature.
To enable that feature on Ekiga simply add the contact with his URI in the roster. If the server supports publishing presence information Ekiga will automatically publish your own presence information and display the presence of contacts in your roster.

Changing properties of a clip over time.
Keyframe curves
By using keyframe curves you can change the value of a property over time instead of having a fixed value for the entire duration of a clip. This can be used to change opacity or volume just as well as effect properties at any point in the clip's duration.
external ref='figures/keyframecurves.png' md5='d91b335281ec48ab9f8fade73bf09852'
You can scroll by
Using the mouse wheel anywhere over the timeline to scroll horizontally or hold down the Shift key while using the mouse wheel to scroll the timeline layers vertically
Clicking anywhere over the timeline with the middle button and dragging the timeline
Using the scrollbars located on the right and bottom of the timeline
Zooming directly affects your editing accuracy and your ability to move quickly along the timeline
Crossfading clips
To do a crossfade between two clips on the same layer simply drag one of the clips onto the other so that it overlaps. The overlapping region will be used as a space for transition between the two clips. You can adjust the length of the transition either by moving the clips or by trimming them. If you want to apply other types of transitions than the default (crossfade) see the Other types of transitions section on this page.
Crossfades are achieved using Pitivi's video mixing features which use keyframes to control the opacity of clips. This means that if you set opacity keyframes for a clip they will be taken into account for the crossfade.
Other types of transitions
Assuming that you have two overlapping clips in your timeline you can achieve other types of transitions by following these steps

Shotwell supports both photos and videos but for simplicity this documentation uses just the term "photos" in most places. Many operations in Shotwell apply to both photos and videos however. In particular events flagging rating tagging and publishing work both for photos and for videos.
Copy photos from a digital camera.
Importing from a camera
To import photos from a digital camera
Connect the camera to your computer and switch it on. Shotwell will detect it and list it in the sidebar.
To change which tags are associated with a particular photo select that photo choose TagsModify Tags or right-click on a photo and select Modify Tags and edit the comma separated list. To remove a tag from one or more photos first select that tag in the sidebar then select the photos you would like to remove and choose TagsRemove Tag "[name]" from Photos or right-click on the photos an select Remove Tag "[name]" from Photos.
To delete a tag entirely select that tag in the sidebar and choose TagsDelete Tag "[name]" or by right-click and select Delete Tag "[name]".

Note that all panel applications have the Lock to Panel item in the right-click menu which locks the position of the panel application on the panel. Do not confuse this with the Lock Notes item.
To lock an individual sticky note right-click on the title of the note then choose Lock Note from the popup menu. To unlock an individual note right-click on the title of the note then choose Lock Note from the popup menu again.

Unsure of a Date?If you're unsure about the date an event occurred Gramps allows you to enter a wide range of date formats based on a guess or an estimate. For instance quot;about 1908quot; is a valid entry for a birth date in Gramps. Click the Date button next to the date field and see the Gramps Manual to learn more.
Duplicate Entriesquot;Tools gt; Database Processing gt; Find Possible Duplicate Peoplequot; allows you to locate (and merge) entries of the same person entered more than once in the database.
Merging EntriesThe function quot;Edit gt; Compare and Mergequot; allows you to combine separately listed people into one. Select the second entry by holding the Control key as you click. This is very useful for combining two databases with overlapping people or combining erroneously entered differing names for one individual. This also works for the Places Sources and Repositories views.
Organising the ViewsMany of the views can present your data as either a hierarchical tree or as a simple list. Each view can also be configured to the way you like it. Have a look to the right of the top toolbar or under the quot;Viewquot; menu.
Navigating Back and ForwardGramps maintains a list of previous active objects such as People and Events. You can move forward and backward through the list using quot;Go gt; Forwardquot; and quot;Go gt; Backquot; or the arrow buttons.

i18n-rekonq; has already replaced konqueror; as the default browser in Chakra and kubuntu; with more distributions expressing similar intent for their future releases.
Like all kde; applications i18n-rekonq; is highly configurable. This document describes how i18n-rekonq; behaves with the normal default settings.
A three button mouse can be useful when you are running i18n-rekonq; or any other kde; application. If your mouse only has two buttons then you should be able to set your system up so that you can simulate a middle mouse button by pressing both buttons at the same time.
If you are used to having to double-click to perform an action then take care because in common with the rest of kde; i18n-rekonq; defaults to single-clicking.

Encoding In general it is a good idea to use your system's standard encoding. Modern systems now move more and more to UTF-8 as the standard encoding. If you can use utf8 or utf8x (which is indeed the correct spelling for latex; documents).
Other options this allows you to set further options such as printing draft and others.
This lists some of the most common additional packages used in latex;. Select the check box to include it.
Author put your name here.
Changes are only effective from \begin{environment} to \end{environment}. There are no limits as to how many changes you can make inside an environment.
There are many features you can add to your document that will make it more readable and user-friendly. You can add features such as specific fonts bold italics underline etc; to your document and these commands will end with either an \end command or at the end of your environment.
\begin{emph} this command makes text italicized and is valid until the code comes across a \end{emph} or another environment. To italicize one word in a sentence you can use the syntax this is \emph{my} sentence.
\textbf{I am making this text inside the brackets bold} this command makes your text bold.
\quote to create a quote inside your document; begin your quote with \begin{quote} and end it with \end{quote}.
Jump to the previous bullet in the text if there is one.
Editing is of course one of the main aspects when you use a program like kile;. Although kate; already has great capabilities kile; adds some important features which are especially needed to write latex; source. latex; always needs a lot of environments and groups so kile; supports very special commands to select them. Under EditSelect you will find the following commands to select text.
Edit->Select items
Ctrl;Alt;S E Environment (inside)
Select an environment without the surrounding tags. If this command is called when an environment is already selected kile; will expand the selection to the next surrounding environment.
If you want to turn this mode on or off go to SettingsConfigure Kile EditorEditingAuto Completion. In this dialog you can configure if completion mode for document words should be enabled. There is also an additional autocompletion mode where a completion box pops up when a certain threshold is reached.
Writing Own Completion Files
The latest specification of the completion file format can found in the  CWL file format specification.
Completion files can be installed in a user's home folder under the /.kde/share/apps/kile/complete/lt;modegt;/ subdirectory where lt;modegt; either stands for abbreviation dictionary or tex.

The Build Tools
Compiling converting and viewing
To view the result of your work you first need to compile the source. All the build tools are grouped closely together in the BuildCompile BuildConvert and BuildView menus.
Using the Context Menu
Most of the entries in the structure view have a lot of entries in the context menu which you can open with a right mouse click. So look at the structure view in the following picture.
You will find some labels some sectioning entries two figure environments and three pictures. If you right click on one of the sectioning entries a menu with some useful commands will popup. All commands like Select Delete or Comment will work with all lines which belong to this section.

Click this button to save the Java policy to a zipped file. The file named javapolicy.tgz will be saved to a location of your choice.
Here you can set specific Java policies for any particular host or domain. To add a new policy simply click the New button and supply the necessary information requested by the dialog box. To change an existing policy click on the Change button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain.
Enabling the security manager will cause the jvm to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system creating arbitrary sockets and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME/.java.policy file with the Java policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
Enabling this will cause the jvm to use KIO for network transport

Chichén Itzá
Chichen Itza meaning “at the mouth of the Itza well” is a Mayan City on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico between Valladolid and Merida. It was established before the period of Christopher Colombus and probably served as the religion center of Yucatan for a while.
Colosseum
The Colosseum or Coliseum is today the most recognizable of Rome's Classical buildings. Even 2000 years after it was built and despite centuries when the abandoned building was pillaged for building materials it is instantly recognizable as a classical template for the stadia of today. It was the first permanent amphitheatre to be raised in Rome and the most impressive arena the Classical world had yet seen.
The Bent Pyramid located at Dahshur was the second pyramid built by pharaoh Sneferu. Mysteriously this true pyramid rises from the desert at an angle of 55 degrees and then suddenly changes to a more gradual angle of 43 degrees. One theory holds that due to the steepness of the original angle the weight to be added above the inner chambers and passageways became too large forcing the builders to adopt a shallower angle. Today the Bent Pyramid is the only pyramid in Egypt of which the outer casing of polished limestone is still largely intact.
Pyramid of Meidum
Five miles south of Saqqara in Egypt stands the mysterious tower-like pyramid of Meidum which today scarcely resembles a typical pyramid at all. The pyramid was probably built during the reign of the 4th Dynasty pharaoh Sneferu although it is believed by some that the pyramid may have been started by Sneferu’s predecessor Huni. At some point during its construction the steps of the pyramid were filled with limestone encasing marking the first attempt by the ancient Egyptians at the construction of a true pyramid.
Red Pyramid
Red Pyramid was one of the finest and successful attempts by Pharaoh Sneferu in building world’s first ever smooth sided pyramid during the Ancient Egypt period. The height of the pyramid is 104 meters making it the world’s 4th largest pyramid in Egypt. The pyramid has been built with red limestone stones and hence the name. The local people of Egypt called it as el-heram el-watwaat meaning the Bat Pyramid.

Read the instructions that give you the range of the number to find. Enter a number in the top right entry box. You will be told if your number is higher or lower. Then enter another number. The distance between Tux and the escape area on the right represents how far you are from the correct number. If Tux is over or under the escape area it means your number is over or under the correct number.

Form mills (line of 3 pieces) to remove pieces of Tux until Tux has only two pieces or doesn't have a legal move
Play with the computer. First take turns to place nine pieces and then take turns to move pieces
You and Tux start with 9 pieces each and take turns to place your pieces on to the empty spots (by clicking on the spots) on the board.
If you form a mill (line of 3 pieces) then select a piece of Tux and remove it. Pieces of formed mill can not be removed unless no other pieces are left on board.
After all the pieces are placed you and Tux will take turns to move them. Click on one of your pieces and then on the adjacent empty spot to move it there. Green color spot indicates where you can move.

While sorting by percentage altitude in the observing list demote objects present in the Dobsonian hole
Check this if you use a large Dobsonian telescope. Sorting by percentage current altitude is an easy way of determining what objects are well-placed for observation. However when using a large Dobsonian telescope objects close to the zenith are hard to observe. Since tracking there corresponds to a rotation in azimuth it is both counterintuitive and requires the observer to frequently move the ladder. The region around the zenith where this is particularly frustrating is called the Dobsonian hole. This checkbox makes the observing list consider objects present in the hole as unfit for observation.

Thumbnail image size. Changing the thumbnail size here triggers a rebuild of the thumbnail database.
If this is set thumbnails are built on demand. As you browse your image database only those thumbnails that are needed are actually built. This means that when you change the thumbnail size KPhotoAlbum will remain responsive even if you have lots of images.If this is not set KPhotoAlbum will always build the thumbnails for all images as soon as possible. This means that when new images are found KPhotoAlbum will immediately build thumbnails for them and you won't have a delay later while browsing.
Choose what aspect ratio the cells holding thumbnails should have.

Filters by default exclude items from the project. Inclusive patterns can be used to include items which where matched by previous exclusive patterns.E.g. to only include files ending on ".cpp" in your project you could exclude all files via "*" and then apply an inclusive "*.cpp" pattern.
A filter with an empty pattern will match all items. Use "*" to make this explicit.
A filter ending on "/" can never match a file.

Ogg Vorbis is a fully free and unencumbered compressed audio format that is perfect for storing your compressed music on your computer. The sound quality is slightly better than MP3 at the same bitrate. Note that not all mobile players support the Ogg Vorbis format.
WAV is a basic uncompressed audio file format. It takes up a lot of space but maintains perfect quality. It is generally not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If you want perfect quality use FLAC instead.
MP3 is the de facto standard in compressed audio compatible with almost all mobile players. It is however non free and generally not recommended.

This is the character set that is used by the client side (i.e. your side) for codepage to charset translations. If you keep the default setting Smb4K will try to automatically determine the charset by looking up the "unix charset" option in the smb.conf.
Client character set

Do not use locking. Do not start lockd.
Translate reserved characters
Translate six of the seven reserved characters (including the colon question mark pipe asterisk greater than and less than characters but not the backslash) to remap range (above 0xF000). This allows you to open files that were created with such characters. This has no effect if the server does not support Unicode.
SMB protocol version
Define which version of the SMB protocol is to be used.

Enable automatic mounting of removable media
When this is checked only remembered devices will be automatically mounted. A device is 'remembered' if it has ever been mounted before. For instance plugging in a USB media player to charge is not sufficient to 'remember' it - if the files are not accessed it will not be automatically mounted the next time it is seen. Once they have been accessed however the device's contents will be automatically made available to the system.
Only automatically mount removable media that has been manually mounted before
If any removable storage devices are connected to your system when you login to your desktop their contents will automatically be made available to your system for other programs to read.

Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as "104-key" models which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs and now you can also have gestures.\n\nJust press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures and after you are finished release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection it still works just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\n\nRight now there are the following gestures available\nmove right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\nmove left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\nmove up and back down  - Up (Alt+Up)\ncircle counterclockwise - Reload (F5)\n\nThe gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields numbered 1 to 9.\n\nNote that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once.  For instance 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\n\nThe conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains 'konqueror').

Watchglass
Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of around 5 - 10cm used in various experimental techniques. The border is bent upwards to allow the watchglass to hold small amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglasses can also be used to cover Petri dishes or beakers and are also suited to weighing small amounts of matter or drying them in an airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.

A maze without walls or enemies - how hard can it be?  But the traps act as walls and the enemies would just fill the traps so perhaps this is another one where you will want to draw a map.  Note that you can probe for traps by digging but that can lead to a rather slow game while you wait for the bricks you dig to refill.

The external program 'dvips' which was used to export the file reported an error. You might wish to look at the document info dialog which you will find in the File-Menu for a precise error report.
The DVI file does not start with the preamble.
The DVI file contains the wrong version of DVI output for this program. Hint If you use the typesetting system Omega you have to use a special program such as oxdvi.
The DVI file is badly corrupted. Okular was not able to find the postamble.
The postamble does not begin with the POST command.

Vorbis' audio quality is not best measured in kilobits per second but on a scale from -1 to 10 called quality.For now quality -1 is roughly equivalent to 45kbps average 5 is roughly 160kbps and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at a quality of 5 or for lossless stereo coupling 6. The quality 3 gives at approximately 110kbps a smaller filesize and significantly better fidelity than .mp3 compression at 128kbps.This explanation is based on the one from the www.vorbis.com FAQ.

Although K3b supports all cdrtools versions since 1.10 it is highly recommended to at least use version 2.0.
Install a more recent version of the cdrtools.
Click "Configure K3b" to solve this problem.
It is highly recommended to configure cdrecord to run with root privileges as then cdrecord runs with high priority that increases the overall stability of the burning process. As well as this it allows the size of the burning buffer to be changed and a lot of user problems can be solved this way.
K3b uses cdrdao to actually write CDs.

Maximal number of read retries
This specifies the maximum number of retries to read a sector of audio data from the cd. After that K3b will either skip the sector if the Ignore Read Errors option is enabled or stop the process.
Do not read the pregaps at the end of every track
If this option is checked K3b will not rip the audio data in the pregaps. Most audio tracks contain an empty pregap which does not belong to the track itself.Although the default behavior of nearly all ripping software is to include the pregaps for most CDs it makes more sense to ignore them. In any case when creating a K3b audio project the pregaps will be regenerated.

When looking for the location of a CRL the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries which are URLs describing the way to access the CRL. The first found DP entry is used.  With this option all entries using the LDAP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

Message Disposition Notification PolicyMDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i.e. read) deleted and dispatched (e.g. forwarded).The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNsIgnore Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended).Ask Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others.Deny Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc.Always send Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and in addition what happened to it (displayed deleted etc.). This option is strongly discouraged but since it makes much sense e.g. for customer relationship management it has been made available.

If the optional "create" argument is specified it instructs the Sieve interpreter to create the specified mailbox if needed before attempting to deliver the message into the specified mailbox.
If the optional "copy" keyword is specified the tagged command does not cancel the implicit "keep". Instead it merely files or redirects a copy in addition to whatever else is happening to the message.
The "keep" action is whatever action is taken in lieu of all other actions if no filtering happens at all; generally this simply means to file the message into the user's main mailbox.

Conflict cache size
This flag only has any effect at --history-level=full.Information about "old" conflicting accesses is stored in a cache of limited size with LRU-style management. This is necessary because it isn't practical to store a stack trace for every single memory access made by the program. Historical information on not recently accessed locations is periodically discarded to free up space in the cache.This option controls the size of the cache in terms of the number of different memory addresses for which conflicting access information is stored. If you find that Helgrind is showing race errors with only one stack instead of the expected two stacks try increasing this value.The minimum value is 10000 and the maximum is 30000000 (thirty times the default value). Increasing the value by 1 increases Helgrind's memory requirement by very roughly 100 bytes so the maximum value will easily eat up three extra gigabytes or so of memory.
When enabled (the default) Helgrind performs lock order consistency checking. For some buggy programs the large number of lock order errors reported can become annoying particularly if you're only interested in race errors. You may therefore find it helpful to disable lock order checking.

Plugins for use in graphics device (e.g. X11()) windows. Part of the official RKWard distribution
The "cairo" library providing SVG-support is not compiled in by default on some systems.
Export the current contents of a graphics device to a postscript/pdf/png/jpeg file either using the native functions or using ghostscript.
Choose an exporting function and a filename to save to. Additional options for size and resolution etc. are also available (see below). Exporting is done using dev.print. For exporting using ghostscript dev2bitmap is used which needs Ghostscript. Most of the exporting parameters are directly sent to the exporting function (postscript pdf svg png or jpeg) by dev.print. Note that there are no 'color' options (like background or foreground color) in this plugin. This is because dev.print simply prints the current graphics (mostly on X11) to the specified file in the chosen format. To set background (or foreground) colors these will need to be provided when calling the plotting function mostly using par(). Note that all the parameters to postscript are also valid parameters to dev2bitmap.
This plugin is only available in the context of a graphics device.

In this section you will learn about some basic methods how to make use of your results in external applications.
Suppose you produced a textual output from tests you performed. Such will be presented in the "output window" of RKWard. It's easy to keep track on your work since a standard of RKWard is to show everything in chronological order together with the date of creation.
See  for details on working with the output. The easiest method of reusing the output is to select the relevant portion and copy and paste them to an office suite.
Basic Analyses
In order to familiarize yourself with RKWard (or with your data) one of the first things to do might be to choose Analysis->Descriptive Statistics from the Menu. You will be presented with a dialog that allows you to select one or more variables to analyse. This looks similar to the workspace browser introduced above. On the additional tabs you can choose which types of descriptive statistics should be calculated.
Here is an example. All tests related to skewness and kurtosis (which you would certainly expect to be shipped as a base package of R) are performed from an external package. If you read this the first time or restarted RKWard after you installed it and try to follow the link you will be out of luck. First you need to run a test from Analysis->Moment in order to achieve this.
Typically you would call them from R via update.packages and library to achieve this. But RKWard simplifies this for you. You'll be guided through the install procedure for the required package. Please note you need root privileges in certain situations.
RKWard claims to take care of seamless integration with an office-suite. Why is there no option to save it as an office file?
RKWard integration with an office-suite
We agree that RKWard is still very lacking when it comes to office integration and "seamless" integration is still far away. Refer to  for information on how to accomplish the most important things right now.
For single(grouped) variable mode Dodging boxes within one or more groups can be a nice option when the outcome is split by several group variables. This allows you to select across how many group variables boxes should be dodged ("0" for no dodging "1" to dodge only the first group variable).
Allows to change the width of the boxes relative to the entire plot.

Kube is a modern communication and collaboration client built with QtQuick on top of a high performance low resource usage core. It provides online and offline access to all your mail contacts calendars notes todo's and more. With a strong focus on usability the team works with designers and UX experts from the ground up to build a product that is not only visually appealing but also a joy to use.
Communication and collaboration within large groups and spread over several time zones is complex and something of the norm in modern projects and the existing solutions available are not up to that challenge. Kube is a way to simplify and make communication elegant again by focusing on the key needs of users instead of filling it with any feature that comes to mind. Our strict focus on what is actually needed instead of what is wanted brings a new way of collaboration between group members and a simpler way of handling communication.

*For Krita 3.3 or later* Krita on Windows can use Direct3D 11 for graphics acceleration (through ANGLE). This is enabled automatically on systems with an Intel GPU.
You might have to disable and enable the touch driver go to the device manager. (Click the guilabel`Start` button and type device manager). Choose HID (User interface devices or something like that). Choose Intel(R) Precise Touch Device. Right click Disable it. Right click Enable it.
Toolbox missing
You can reset the Workspace by pressing the right most button on the toolbar the Workspace switcher and click on a desired Workspace from the list.
Or you can right-click on any docker title bar or open space in any toolbar and select Toolbox. It's the first option.
Also you can check the guilabel`Settings` menu it has got a lot of interesting stuff then go to the Dockers menu and select guilabel`Toolbox`.
Gitlab (KDE Invent)
Gitlab serves the following purposes for the Krita team
Review volunteers' submissions https//invent.kde.org/kde/krita/mergerequests for the code itself https//invent.kde.org/websites/docs-krita-org/mergerequests for the content of the Krita Manual.
Host the code git repository https//invent.kde.org/kde/krita . Note that while there are mirrors of our git repository on Github and Phabricator we do not use them for Krita development.

Creating merge requests using Edit mode
Recommended for users without a technical knowledge.
Not recommended when you want to change more than one file at once. (See ref`merge-request-webide` or ref`merge-request-terminal` if you want to change more files or simply edit only one per merge request).
If you have a lot of changes you want to contribute we recommend trying to follow these instructions.
Get a KDE identity.
Before the ``draft`` branch is merged for a given release
The master branch will be tagged with the old version.
The draft branch is first double checked that it has updated version number and updated epub cover.
The ``draft`` branch will not be merged until the day before a release to keep the pages intact for long enough.
Each release will have a version of the epub uploaded as part of the release process. .. Where do we get the POT files from? Even the translated versions?

Editing the metadata of a file
Sometimes personal information gets embedded into an image file. Othertimes we want to embed information into a file to document it better.
There are no less than 3 to 4 different ways of handling metadata and metadata has different ways of handling certain files.
Is it possible to reproduce (repeat)? If yes provide a step-by-step instruction to get the crash.
Backtrace (crashlog) -- the instruction is here ref`drminw` and the debug symbols can be found in the annoucement of the version of Krita that the user has. But it could be easier to just point the user to `https//download.kde.org/stable/krita `.
Other possible questions with quick solutions
When the user has any weird issue something you've never heard about ask them to reset the configuration ref`faqresetkritaconfiguration`.
When the user has trouble with anything related to preview or display ask them to change guilabel`Canvas Graphics Acceleration` in menuselection`Settings --> Configure Krita --> Display`.
We'll go into what these terms mean in the theory but if you're here only for trying to figure out which is the default you now know it. Maybe after reading this you may feel like changing the default to get new and interesting results from filters blending modes or just the color smudge brush.
What is the problem?
To explain the point of color management you'd first need to learn which problem color management tries to solve.
Let us imagine a kinder garden
The class of 28 children is subdivided in groups of 7. Each group has its own table.
Example workflows
Here are some example workflows to get a feeling of how your color management workflow may look like.
As mentioned before input for your screen is set via menuselection`Settings --> Configure Krita --> Color management` or via the LUT docker's 'screen space'. Working space is set via new file per document or in the LUT docker via 'input space'.
Webcomic
Your screen profile. (You pick colors via your screen)
How vibrant a color is. Saturation is slightly different between HSV and the others. In HSV it's a measurement of the difference between two base colors being used and three base colors being used. In the others it's a measurement of how close a color is to gray and sometimes this value is called **Chroma**. Saturation ranges from 0 (gray) to 100 (pure color).
Sometimes known as Brightness. Measurement of how much the pixel needs to light up. Also measured from 0 to 100.
Where a color aligns between white and black. This value is non-linear and puts all the most saturated possible colors at 50. Ranges from 0 to 100.
Similar to lightness except it acknowledges that yellow (110) is lighter than blue (001). Ranges from 0 to 100.
Luma (Y')
Even if you do not paint much but are for example making textures for a videogame or rendering using a linear space is very beneficial and will speed up the renderer a little for it won't have to convert images on its own.
The downside of linear space is of course that white seems very overpowered when mixing with black because in a linear space light grays get more room. In the end while linear space is physically correct and a boon to work in when you are dealing with physically correct renderers for videogames and raytracing Krita is a tool and no-one will hunt you down for preferring the dark mixing of the sRGB TRC.
Profiling and Calibration
So to make it simple a color profile is just a file defining a set of colors inside a pure XYZ color cube. This "color set" can be used to define different things
the colors inside an image
By setting the nits slider in the ref`smallcolorselector` higher than 100.
Or simply by opening the internal color selector by double clicking the dual color button and typing in values higher than 1 into the input field.
And finally by picking a really bright color from an image that has such values.
Then paint. It’s recommended to make a bunch of swatches in the corner at the least until Krita’s new Palette docker allows you to save the values properly.
Lighting based workflow
Use color as mask
This'll turn the darkest values of the image as the ones that paint and the whitest as transparent. Untick this if you are using colored images for the brush.
GBR brushes are otherwise unremarkable and limited to 8bit color precision.
The GIF file format in Krita.
*.gif
While you can open up SVG files with any text-editor to edit them it is best to use a vector program like Inkscape. Krita 2.9 to 3.3 supports importing SVG via the add shape docker. Since Krita 4.0 SVGs can be properly imported and you can export singlevector layers via menuselection`Layer --> Import/Export --> Save Vector Layer as SVG`. For 4.0 Krita will also use SVG to save vector data into its ref`internal format `.
SVG is designed for the internet though sadly because vector graphics are considered a bit obscure compared to raster graphics not a lot of websites accept them yet. Hosting them on your own webhost works just fine though.

One more for the road
Here you can see that the misalignment of the vanishing point to the projection plane causes skewing which was then fixed by Krita’s transform tools technically it’s of course correct but what is correct doesn’t always look good. (I also mess up the position of the shoulder for a good while if you look closely.)
Conclusion and afterthoughts
I probably didn’t make as nice result images as I could have especially if you compare it to the 3d images. However you can still see that the main landmarks are there. The real use of this technique lies in poses though and it allows you to iterate on a pose quite quickly once you get the hang of it.
Generally it’s worth exploring if only because it improves your spatial sense.

To decrease bristle density you can also just use an autobrush and decrease the brush tip's density or increase its randomness.

The core of this particular brush-engine.
Think of it as pressing down on a brush to make the bristles further apart.
The Color Smudge Brush offers 2 modes accessible from the guilabel`Smudge Rate` section
Smearing This mode mixes colors by smudging ("smearing") the area underneath.
Dulling In his mode the brush "picks up" the color underneath it mixes it with its own color then paints with it.
.. image images/brushes/Krita-tutorial5-I.1.png
To better demonstrate the smudge function I turned the color rate function off.
.. image images/brushes/Krita-tutorial5-III.2-1.png
This remains in fact a so-so way of making smooth transitions. It's best to build up intermediate values instead. Here
I first passed over the blue area three times with a red color. I select 3 shades.
I color picked each of these values with the kbd`Ctrl +` |mouseleft| shortcut then used them in succession.

The Dyna Brush Engine manual page.
Dyna Brush Engine
.. image images/icons/dynabrush.svg
Dyna brush uses dynamic setting like mass and drag to draw strokes. The results are fun and random spinning strokes. To experiment more with this brush you can play with values in 'dynamic settings' section of the brush editor under Dyna Brush.
-45 degrees plane then +45 degrees plane see example.
+45 degrees plane then -45 degrees plane see example actually not much different from the above it's mostly the order that changes when using dynamics.
Moiré pattern See example.
The Crosshatching dynamic only works if you have already chosen a crosshatching style. When that happens the crosshatching only gets drawn according to the conditions of the dynamics (pressure speed angle).
With most hatching styles using crosshatching dynamics basically gets you the same hatching style minus the occasional line.
Distance Opacity
The distance based opacity. When you move your pen fast when painting the opacity will be calculated based on the distance from the center of the effect area.
This mode exists for performance reasons and doesn't affect the output in a visible way. Check this for large brushes or thick lines for faster rendering.
Mix with background color.
The Spray Brush Engine manual page.
First there are three mask-types with each the circle and square shape
This is the ultimate generic type. The Fade parameter produces the below results. Of the three auto brushes this is the fastest.
This one's fade is controlled by a curve!
This one uses the gaussian algorithm to determine the fade. Out of the three auto brushes this is the slowest.
The pixel size of the brush.

If you hold the brush still but are still pressing down this will keep adding color onto the canvas. The lower the rate the quicker the color gets added.
.. image images/brushes/KritaPixelBrushSettingsMirror.png
This allows you to mirror the Brush-tip with Sensors.
Cutoff policy
Cutoff is the grayscale range that you can limit the texture to. This also affects the limit takes by the strength. In the below example we move from the right arrow moved close to the left one resulting in only the darkest values being drawn. After that three images with larger range and underneath that three ranges with the left arrow moved result in the darkest values being cut away leaving only the lightest. The last example is the pattern without cutoff.
Invert the pattern.
Brightness and Contrast
Adjust the pattern with a simple brightness/contrast filter to make it easier to use. Because Subtract and Multiply work differently it's recommended to use different values with each

Animation Curves Docker
The Animation Curve docker allows you to edit tweened sections by means of interpolation curves. As of this time of writing it can only edit opacity.
.. image images/dockers/KritaBrushPresetDocker.png
This docker allows you to switch the current brush you're using as well as tagging the brushes.
Just |mouseleft| on an icon to switch to that brush!

Overview of the channels docker.
The angle of the lines. Set both angles to 30° for true isometric.
Determines how much both sets of lines are spaced.
Offsets the grid’s starting position from the top-left corner of the document in pixels.
Controls the look of the grid’s main lines.
Controls the look of the grid’s “subdivision” lines.
Look Up Table
The Look Up Table (LUT) Management docker controls the high dynamic range (HDR) painting functionality.
Use Open Color IO instead of Krita's internal color management. Open Color IO is a color management library. It is sometimes referred to as OCIO. This is required as Krita uses OCIO for its HDR functionality.
Choose the engine.
Use an OCIO configuration file from your computer.
The small color selector is the only selector which can show HDR values. When your build of Krita is HDR enabled and you are on Windows you can drag the slider at the bottom to increase the 'nits' of the colors in the small selector. This is the direct value of the brightness of the colors and you need a value above 100 (100 being the maximum value used for the brightest value of sRGB colors) to have an HDR color. The small color selector will also select wide gamut values.
Overview of the snap settings docker.
This docker has been removed in Krita 3.0. For more information on how to do this instead consult the ref`snapping page `.
.. image images/dockers/KritaSnapSettingsDocker.png
This is docker only applies for Vector Layers. Snapping determines where a vector shape will snap. The little number box is for snapping to a grid.
According to this parameter -- groups are made. Every stroke is put into the same group till two consecutive strokes have a time gap of more than T seconds. Then a new group is started.
A user may want to keep the ability of Undoing/Redoing his last N strokes. Once N is crossed -- the earlier strokes are merged into the group's first stroke.

With filter masks we can for example make this ghost-lady more ethereal by putting a clone layer underneath and setting a lens-blur filter on it.
Set the blending mode of the clone layer to guilabel`Color Dodge` and she becomes really spooky!
Unlike applying a filter to a section of a paint layer directly filter masks do not permanently alter the original image. This means you can tweak the filter (or the area it applies to) at any time. Changes can always be altered or removed.
Unlike filter layers filter masks apply only to the area you have selected (the mask).
You can edit the settings for a filter mask at any time by double clicking on it in the Layers docker. You can also change the selection that the filter mask affects by selecting the filter mask in the Layers docker and then using the paint tools in the main window. Painting white includes the area painting black excludes it and all other colors are turned into a shade of gray which applies proportionally.

program`Krita` as a painting program juggles a lot of data around like the brushes you use the colors you picked but primarily each pixel in your image. Due to this how program`Krita` organizes where it stores all the data can really speed up program`Krita` while painting just like having an organized artist's workplace can really speed up the painting process in real life.
These preferences allow you to configure program`Krita's` organisation but all do require you to restart program`Krita` so it can do this organisation properly.
RAM or Random Access Memory is the memory your computer is immediately using. The difference between RAM and the hard drive memory can be compared to the difference between having files on your desk and having files safely stored away in an archiving room The files on your desk as much easier to access than the ones in your archive and it takes time to pull new files from the archive. This is the same for your computer and RAM. Files need to be loaded into RAM before the computer can really use them and storing and removing them from RAM takes time.
These settings allow you to choose how much of your virtual desk you dedicate to program`Krita`. program`Krita` will then reserve them on start-up. This does mean that if you change any of the given options you need to restart program`Krita` so it can make this reservation.
This is the maximum space program`Krita` will reserve on your RAM on startup. It's both available in percentages and Bytes so you can specify precisely. program`Krita` will not take up more space than this making it safe for you to run an internet browser or music on the background.
If you have no blue line when drawing on the lefthand drawing area Krita cannot access your tablet. Check out the ref`page on drawing tablets ` for suggestions on what is causing this.
When you draw a line the output on the right will show all sorts of text output. This text output can be attached to a help request or a bug report to figure out what is going on.

How to use the render animation command in Krita.
Render animation allows you to render your animation to an image sequence gif mp4 mkv or ogg file. It replaces guilabel`Export Animation`.
Let's say that there is an image of an evergreen tree that we're pretty sure is going to be a regular feature in some of our paintings and we want to have a dedicated brush for it.  To do this we would do the following
Click on the image of the tree we want
Change the name of the brush at the very top of the Brush Editor Settings dialog.  Something like "Trees - Tall Evergreen" would be appropriate.
Click the "Save to Presets" button
Now that you have a "Tall Evergreen" brush safely saved you can experiment with the settings to see if there is anything you would like to change for instance by altering the size setting and the pressure parameter you could set the brush to change the tree size depending on the pressure you were using with your stylus (assuming you have a stylus!).
The channel separation dialog in Krita
Channel Separation
The separate image dialog allows you to separate the channels of the image into layers. This is useful in game texturing workflows as well as more advanced CMYK workflows. When confirming guilabel`Separate Image` creates a series of layers for each channel. So for RGB it will create Red Green and Blue layers each representing the pixels of that channel and for CMYK Cyan Magenta Yellow and Key layers.
Which part of the image should be separated.
The active layer.
This image has the line art for the lady separated from the background and what's more the background is made up of two layers one main and one for the details.
First select the colorize mask editing tool while having the line art layer selected. |mouseleft| the canvas will add a colorize mask to the layer. You can also |mouseright| the line art layer and then menuselection`Add --> Colorize Mask`. The line art will suddenly become really weird this is the prefiltering which are filters through which we put the line art to make the algorithm easier to use. The tool options overview below shows which options control that.
Now you make strokes with brush colors press guilabel`Update` in the tool options or tick the last icon of the colorize mask properties. In the layer docker you will be able to see a little progress bar appear on the colorize mask indicating how long it takes. The bigger your file the longer it will take.
We want to have the blue transparent. In the tool options of the colorize editing tool you will see a small palette. These are the colors already used. You can remove colors here or mark a single color as standing for transparent by selecting it and pressing "transparent". Updating the mask will still show the blue stroke but the result will be transparent
Because the colorize mask algorithm is slow and we only need a part of our layer to be filled to fill the whole ghost lady figure we can make use of guilabel`Limit to layer bounds`. This will limit Colorize Mask to use the combined size of the line art and the coloring key strokes. Therefore make sure that the colorizing keystrokes only take up as much as they really need.

|toolfill|
Krita has one of the most powerful and capable Fill functions available. The options found in the Tool Options docker and outlined below will give you a great deal of flexibility working with layers and selections.
To get started clicking anywhere on screen with the fill-tool will allow that area to be filed with the foreground color.
This allows you to set how much and in which units the kbd`Left Arrow` kbd`Up Arrow` kbd`Right Arrow` and kbd`Down Arrow` cursor key actions will move the layer.
Large Move Scale (3.0+)
Allows you to multiply the movement of the Shortcut Move Distance when pressing the kbd`Shift` key before pressing a direction key.
Show coordinates
When toggled will show the coordinates of the top-left pixel of the moved layer in a floating window.

Turn the selected node into a sharp corner This will remove the side handles.
Make Curve Point
Turn the selected node into one that can curve This will add side handles to the node.

|tooltext|
This tool allows you to add text to your artwork.
You use it by doing |mouseleft| + drag to create a rectangular selection. When releasing |mouseleft| a default text will be created and the text editor window will pop-up.
Hovering over other text shapes will highlight their bounding box. |mouseleft| on a highlighted text will select it as the active text.

These are not stored in the rich text right now and while they can be written into the SVG text the SVG text-shape doesn't do anything with them.
Krita generates font-size-adjust for the font when coming from rich text as this can help designers when they want to use the SVG source as a basis for later adjustments.

The flats colors will be placed on a separate layer. You can check `this ` tutorial by David Revoy to know more about this technique.
GMIC Colorize [comics]
Krita provides one more option to prepare flat colors through G'MIC colorize comics filter. This technique needs some preparations before you run the G'MIC filter. This layer extrapolates the color spots that you input below the line art
You have to create two layers below the line art one for the color spots indicating which color you need to be filled in the region and one for the final extrapolated output of the filter. Mark some colors spots in the layer beneath the line art. The layer setup can be seen in the image below.
The colors spots are marked in red in the image

You can also make small bezier curves with the ref`assistanttool` amongst the other tools there.
Then in the freehand brush tool options you can tick guilabel`Snap to Assistants` and start a line that snaps to this assistant.
So here are some things to consider with the brush-presets that you use
Anti-aliasing versus jagged pixels
A starting inker might be inclined to always want to use anti-aliased brushes after all they look so smooth on the screen. However while these look good on screen they might become fuzzy when printing them. Therefore Krita comes with two default types. Anti-aliased brushes like inkbrush25 and slightly aliased brushes like inktilt with the latter giving better print results. If you are trying to prepare for both it might be an idea to consider making the inking page 600dpi and the color page 300dpi so that the inking page has a higher resolution and the ‘jaggies’ aren’t as visible. You can turn any pixel brush into an aliased brush by going the kbd`F5` key and ticking **Sharpness**.
Brush-tipsSculpt-paint-brush
**How do I make a brush like the one in Sinix's paint-like-a-sculptor video?**
It's actually quite easy but most easy to do since Krita 3.0 due a few bugfixes.
First select *BasicWet* from the default presets and go into the brush editor with the kbd`F5` key.
Then the trick is to go into **Opacity** untoggle **Pressure** from the sensors toggle **Fade** and then reverse the curve as shown above. Make sure that the curve ends a little above the bottom-right so that you are always painting something. Otherwise the smudge won't work.
Use the straight line tool to draw a single horizontal line. This is the ground.
.. image images/animation/Introductiontoanimation05.png
Then select the 'walkcycle' layer and draw a head and torso (you can use any brush for this).
Now selecting a new frame will not make a new frame automatically. Krita doesn't actually see the 'walkcycle' layer as an animated layer at all!
.. image images/animation/Introductiontoanimation06.png
If you save your work and continue or close Krita and do save your work the AutoSave file will be removed.
AutoSave for Saved Files
If you had already saved your work Krita will create a named AutoSave file.
A hidden named autosave file will look like ``.myimage.kra-autosave.kra``.
By default named AutoSave files are hidden. Named AutoSave files are placed in the same folder as the file you were working on.
There you can create new shapes and modify the mask with standard vector tools (ref`vectorgraphics`). Please note that the mask is intended to be composed of basic vector shapes. Although interesting results might arise from using advanced vector drawing techniques not all features are guaranteed to work properly (e.g. grouping vector text etc.).
Transformations done through the transform tool or layer transform cannot be saved in a gamut mask. The thumbnail image reflects the changes but the individual mask shapes do not.
You can guilabel`Preview` the mask in the color selector (4). If you are satisfied with your changes guilabel`Save` the mask (5). guilabel`Cancel` (3) will close the editing view without saving your changes.

Just like Red Green and Blue the computer can also store how transparent a pixel is. This is important for **compositing** as mentioned before. After all there's no point in having multiple layers if you can't have transparency.
Transparency is stored in the same way as colors meaning that it's also a channel. We usually call this channel the **alpha channel** or **alpha** for short. The reason behind this is that the letter 'α' is used to represent it in programming.
Some older programs don't always have transparency by default. Krita is the opposite it doesn't understand images that don't track transparency and will always add a transparency channel to images. When a given pixel is completely transparent on all layers Krita will instead show a checkerboard pattern like the rose image shown above.
Blending modes
Because colors are stored as numbers you can do maths with them. We call this **Blending Modes** or **Compositing Modes**.
You can compile it optimized for your processor. Most pre-built packages are built for the lowest-common denominator.
You will be getting all the bug fixes as soon as possible as well.
You can help the developers by giving us your feedback on features as they are being developed and you can test bug fixes for us. This is hugely important which is why our regular testers get their name in the about box just like developers.
Of course there are also some disadvantages when building from the current development source repository you also get all the unfinished features. It might mean less stability for a while or things shown in the user interface that don't work. But in practice there is seldom really bad instability and if it is it's easy for you to go back to a revision that does work.
So If you want to start compiling from source begin with the latest build instructions from the guide ref`here `.
You can scale selection. To do this choose menuselection`Select --> Scale`.
Also in the guilabel`Select` menu there are more classical options to grow shrink feather border etc.
If you enable guilabel`Show Global Selection Mask` (guilabel`Select` menu) you can scale/rotate/transform/move or paint on selection like on regular grayscale layer.
kbd`Ctrl + H` Show / Hide selection (same shortcut)
kbd`Ctrl + A` Select All
Using these tips you will probably be up to speed with Krita in a short time. If you find other things worth mentioning in this document we the authors would be interested in hearing about them. Krita develops fast so we believe that the list of things possible in Photoshop but not in Krita will become shorter in time. We will maintain this document as this happens.
This is a introduction to Krita for users coming from Paint Tool Sai.

This is due difference between 24 drawing per second which is used in Full Animation and 12 drawing per second and 8 drawings per second which are used in Limited Animation on the Timeline docker.
.. image images/animation/2412and8drawingpersec.png
This is correspondence between Timeline and Time sheet. "Black" layer is to draw main line art which are used ordinary line art "Red" layer is to draw red auxiliary linearts which are used to specify highlights "Blue" layer is to draw blue auxiliary linearts which are used to specify shadows and "Shadow" layer is to draw light green auxiliary line art which are used to specify darker shadows. However probably you have to increase or decrease these layers according to your work.

The top drop-down is set to “all” by default which means it shows all engines. It then shows a tag section where you can select the tags the preset list and the search bar.
Underneath that there's a plus icon which when pressed gives you the full list of Krita's engines. Selecting an engine from the list will show the brushes for that engine.
The trashcan icon does the same as it does in the preset docker delete or rather blacklist a preset so it won't show up in the list.
Section C - The Scratch pad
When you tweak your brushes you want to be able to check what each setting does. That's why to the right of the settings drop-down there is a scratch pad.
Using a ZIP with the relevant files.
Go to menuselection`Settings --> Manage Resources --> Open Resource Folder` to open the resource folder.
Then open up the zip file.
Copy the brushes paintoppresets and patterns folders from the zip file to the resource folder. You should get a prompt to merge the folders agree to this.
Restart Krita.
This section covers python scripting.
-DENABLEPYTHON2=ON
Introduction to using Krita's python plugin API.
Introduction to Python Scripting
When we offered python scripting as one of Kickstarter Stretchgoals we could implement next to vectors and text it won the backer vote by a landslide. Some people even only picked python and nothing else. So what exactly is python scripting?
the name of a possible icon. These will only show up on KDE plasma because Gnome and Windows users complained they look ugly.
The text that it will show in the shortcut editor.
whatsThis
The text it will show when a Qt application specifically calls for 'what is this' which is a help action.
toolTip
You can also do this for adding subtracting and intersecting by going to menuselection`Select --> Select Opaque` where you can find specific actions for each.
If you want to quickly select parts of layers you can hold the kbd`Ctrl +` |mouseleft| shortcut on the layer *thumbnail*. To add a selection do kbd`Ctrl + Shift +` |mouseleft| to remove kbd`Ctrl + Alt +` |mouseleft| and to intersect kbd`Ctrl + Shift + Alt +` |mouseleft|. This works with any mask that has pixel or vector data (so everything but transform masks).
Pixel and Vector Selection Types
Vector selections allow you to modify your selection with vector anchor tools. Pixel selections allow you to modify selections with pixel information. They both have their benefits and disadvantages. You can convert one type of selection to another.
.. image images/selection/Vector-pixel-selections.jpg
Assigning an Existing Tag to a Brush
Right-click on a brush in the Brush Presets Docker. You will get an option to assign a tag to the brush.
Changing a Tag's Name
Select the existing tag that you want to have changed from the drop-down. Press the guilabel`+` icon next to the tag. You will get an option to rename it. Press the kbd`Enter` key to confirm. All the existing brushes will remain in the newly named tag.
Deleting a Tag
.. image images/documentinformationscreen.png
Krita will automatically save who created the image into your image's metadata. Along with the other data such as time and date of creation and modification Krita also shows editing time of a document in the document information dialog useful for professional illustrators speed-painters to keep track of the time they worked on artwork for billing purposes. It detects when you haven’t performed actions for a while and has a precision of ±60 seconds. You can empty it in the document info dialog and of course by unzipping you .kra file and editing the metadata there.
These things can be edited in menuselection`File --> Document Information` and for the author's information menuselection`Settings --> Configure Krita --> Author Information`. Profiles can be switched under menuselection`Settings --> Active Author Profile`.
Setting the canvas background color
You can set the canvas background color via menuselection`Image --> Image Background Color and Transparency`. This allows you to turn the background color non-transparent and to change the color. This is also useful for certain file formats which force a background color instead of transparency. PNG and JPG export use this color as the default color to fill in transparency if you do not want to export transparency.

KDE is embracing all the app stores.  We can now deliver more and more of our programs directly to you the user.  One of the leading app stores on Linux is [Flathub](https//flathub.org/home) which uses the FlatPak format.
You may well already have Flatpak and Flathub configured on your system and ready to use in Discover or other app installers.  For example KDE neon has set it up by default on installs for over a year now.  If not it's a quick [setup process](https//flatpak.org/setup/) for all the major distros.
If you're interested in the techy details you can browse [KDE's Flatpak packaging repo](https//phabricator.kde.org/source/flatpak-kde-applications/) and read the [KDE Flatpak guide](https//community.kde.org/GuidelinesandHOWTOs/Flatpak).
But probably what you're interested in is the apps so take a look at what the [Flathub store has under KDE](https//flathub.org/apps/search/kde).

KDE Applications Improve Usability Performance and Take You to Mars
Less intrusive Notifications in Kate
Kate—KDE's Advanced Text Editor—received improvements in many areas. Thanks to an intensive KDE e.V.-sponsored coding sprint in October Kate got an improved notification system an optional 'minimap' as scrollbar a new Project Management plugin predefined color schemes improvements to the scripting interface and much more. A great bugfixing effort reduced the number of open bug reports from 850 to 60. Outside of the coding sprint work was done to create a new Quick Open functionality and other enhancements. All these improvements also benefit applications using Kate Part for text editing including the lightweight KWrite text editor and KDevelop the complete KDE Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
In the area of games and education several smaller and larger new features and optimizations have arrived. Prospective touch typists might enjoy the right-to-left support in KTouch while the star-gazer's friend KStars now has a tool which shows interesting events coming up in your area. Math tools Rocs Kig Cantor and KAlgebra all got attention supporting more backends and calculations. And the KJumpingCube game now has features larger board sizes new skill levels faster responses and an improved user interface.
The Kolourpaint simple painting application can deal with the WebP image format and the universal document viewer Okular has configurable review tools and introduces undo/redo support in forms and annotations. The JuK audio tagger/player supports playback and metadata editing of the new Ogg Opus audio format (however this requires that the audio driver and TagLib also support Ogg Opus).
The KDE Plasma Workspaces 4.11
Plasma Workspaces 4.11 Continues to Refine User Experience
Gearing up for long term maintenance Plasma Workspaces delivers further improvements to basic functionality with a smoother taskbar smarter battery widget and improved sound mixer. The introduction of KScreen brings intelligent multi-monitor handling to the Workspaces and large scale performance improvements combined with small usability tweaks make for an overall nicer experience.
KDE Software Compilation 4.14
August 20 2014
This release is dedicated to Volker Lanz a long time KDE member who passed away last April. Volker was the author and maintainer of KDE Partition Manager and a regular IRC participant (Torch) providing user support and being active in the KDE Community.
The KDE Community announces the latest major updates to KDE Applications delivering primarily improvements and bugfixes. Plasma Workspaces and the KDE Development Platform are frozen and receiving only long term support; those teams are focused on the transition to Plasma 5 and Frameworks 5.
In the past KDE has jointly released the three major divisions of KDE software—Plasma Workspaces KDE Development Platform and KDE Applications. The KDE Development Platform has been reworked into KDE Frameworks. The monolithic libraries that comprise the Development Platform are now independent cross platform modules (KDE Frameworks 5) that are available to all Qt developers. Plasma Workspaces has been moved to a new technology foundation based on Qt5 and KDE Frameworks 5. With the 3 major KDE software components moving at different paces their release schedules are now separated. For the most part 4.14 involves KDE Applications.
For a current list of available binary packages of which the KDE Project has been informed please visit the 4.10.5 Info Page.
Compiling 4.10.5
The complete source code for 4.10.5 may be freely downloaded. Instructions on compiling and installing 4.10.5 are available from the 4.10.5 Info Page.
KDE Ships First Beta of Plasma Workspaces Applications and Platform 4.11
June 13 2013. Today KDE released the beta of the new versions of Workspaces Applications and Development Platform. With API dependency and feature freezes in place the KDE team's focus is now on fixing bugs and further polishing.
Some Linux/UNIX OS vendors have kindly provided binary packages of 4.12 Beta1 (internally 4.11.80) for some versions of their distribution and in other cases community volunteers have done so. Additional binary packages as well as updates to the packages now available may become available over the coming weeks.
Compiling 4.12 Beta1
The complete source code for 4.12 Beta1 may be freely downloaded. Instructions on compiling and installing 4.11.80 are available from the 4.11.80 Info Page.

The 'Fit Width' feature has been replaced with a more generalized 'Fill' function.
Even smaller enhancements often can make user's workflows more enjoyable
To improve consistency SVG images are now enlarged like all other images when 'Image View → Enlarge Smaller Images' is turned on.
After editing an image or undoing changes image view and thumbnail won't get out of sync anymore.
When renaming images the filename extension will be unselected by default and the 'Move/Copy/Link' dialog now defaults to showing the current folder.
For small SVG images the selection highlight matches the image size.
A number of smaller enhancements was introduced to make your workflow even more enjoyable
Improved the fade transitions between images of varying sizes and transparencies.
Fixed the visibility of icons in some floating buttons when a light color scheme is used.
When saving an image under a new name the viewer does not jump to an unrelated image afterwards.
When a mouse with back and forward buttons is plugged in Konsole can now use those buttons for switching between tabs
Konsole now has a menu item to reset the font size to the profile default if it has been enlarged or reduced in size
Tabs are now harder to accidentally detach and faster to accurately re-order
Improved shift-click selection behavior
Fixed double-clicking on a text line that exceeds the window width
We fixed the timeline corruption bug that misplaced or missed clips which was triggered when you moved a group of clips.
We fixed the JPG image bug that rendered images as white screens on Windows. We also fixed the bugs affecting screen capture on Windows.
Apart from all of the above we have added many small usability enhancements that will make using Kdenlive easier and smoother.
Okular is KDE's multipurpose document viewer. Ideal for reading and annotating PDFs it can also open ODF files (as used by LibreOffice and OpenOffice) ebooks published as ePub files most common comic book files PostScript files and many more.
To help you ensure your documents are always a perfect fit we've added scaling options to Okular's Print dialog.
The KDE Applications 19.08 releases need a thorough testing in order to maintain and improve the quality and user experience.

We're counting on you to help find bugs early so they can be squashed before the final release. Please consider joining the team by installing the Release Candidate and reporting any bugs.
KDE Ships KDE Applications 19.08.0
August 15 2019.
This release is part of KDE's commitment to continually provide improved versions of the programs we ship to our users. New versions of Applications bring more features and better-designed software that increases the usability and stability of apps like Dolphin Konsole Kate Okular and all your other favorite KDE utilities. Our aim is to ensure you remain productive and to make KDE software easier and more enjoyable for you to use.
Dolphin is KDE's file and folder explorer which you can now launch from anywhere using the new global Meta + E shortcut. There is also a new feature that minimizes clutter on your desktop. When Dolphin is already running if you open folders with other apps those folders will open in a new tab in the existing window instead of a new Dolphin window. Note that this behavior is now on by default but it can be disabled.
KDE is a Free Software community that exists and grows only because of the help of many volunteers that donate their time and effort. KDE is always looking for new volunteers and contributions whether it is help with coding bug fixing or reporting writing documentation translations promotion money etc. All contributions are gratefully appreciated and eagerly accepted. Please read through the Supporting KDE page for further information or become a KDE e.V. supporting member through our Join the Game initiative. 
Frameworks 5 Technology Preview
January 7 2014. The KDE Community is proud to announce a Tech Preview of KDE Frameworks 5. Frameworks 5 is the result of almost three years of work to plan modularize review and port the set of libraries previously known as KDElibs or KDE Platform 4 into a set of Qt Addons separate libraries with well-defined dependencies and abilities ready for Qt 5. This gives the Qt ecosystem a powerful set of drop-in libraries providing additional functionality for a wide variety of tasks and platforms based on over 15 years of KDE experience in building applications. Today all the Frameworks are available in Tech Preview mode; a final release is planned for the first half of 2014. Some Tech Preview addons (notably KArchive and Threadweaver) are more mature than others at this time.
What is Frameworks 5?
The KDE libraries are currently the common code base for (almost) all KDE applications. They provide high-level functionality such as toolbars and menus spell checking and file access. Currently 'kdelibs' is distributed as a single set of interconnected libraries. Through KDE Frameworks efforts these libraries have been methodically reworked into a set of independent cross platform libraries that will be readily available to all Qt developers.

Fix for QtCurve settings crash when using global menu
A wide variety of issues with the Breeze-GTK theme have been resolved including the inconsistencies between the light and dark variants. We have also made the theme more maintainable so future improvements will be much easier.
Distro Release Upgrade Notification
Options for upgrading your distribution are now included in Discover’s Update Notifier widget. The widget will also display a “Restart” button if a restart is recommended after applying all updates but the user hasn’t actually restarted yet.
On Discover’s Updates page it’s now possible to uncheck and re-check all available updates to make it easier to pick and choose the ones you want to apply.
Discover’s Settings page has been renamed to “Sources” and now has pushbuttons instead of hamburger menus.
There is now full support for configuring touchpads using the Libinput driver on X11.
Initial support for using Wayland with proprietary Nvidia drivers has been added. When using Qt 5.13 with this driver graphics are also no longer distorted after waking the computer from sleep.
Wayland now features drag and drop between XWayland and Wayland native windows.
Also on Wayland the System Settings Libinput touchpad page now allows you to configure the click method switching between "areas" or "clickfinger".
KWin's blur effect now looks more natural and correct to the human eye by not unnecessary darkening the area between blurred colors.
Active and inactive tabs in Google Chrome and Chromium now look visually distinct
Sidebars in settings windows now have a consistent modernized appearance
CGroups in System Monitor
System Monitor can now show CGroup details to look at container limits
Each process can now report its network usage statistics
Plasma 5.3 Beta
Inform what is blocking power saving
Battery applet now informs what is blocking power saving
Energy Usage monitor
New energy usage monitor
The color picker applet lets you pick a color from anywhere on the screen and automatically copies its color code to the clipboard in a variety of formats (RGB Hex Qt QML rgba LaTeX).
User Switcher Plasma Applet
User switching has been updated and improved and is now accessible from the Application Launcher the new User Switcher applet and in the lock screen.  It shows the user's full name and user  set avatar.  This is very useful for offices with shared desks.  More info in the developer blog.
Plasma 5.5 sees a new applet designed for business environments or universities. This applet will show you usage assessed not around the real disk usage but your allowed quota by your system administrator.
Done for users whose use case of activities partly overlaps with virtual desktops it looks like a pager it behaves like a pager but uses activities instead of virtual desktops. This gives a quick glimpse of what activities are running and how many windows are associated to each activity.

As we approach the end of the year we begin the season of giving. What would suit the holiday better than giving to the entire world?
Here is a unique way to give back to KDE allowing us to keep giving free software to humankind.
KDE is committed to improving technology and software to make the world a better place. We produce great quality free software that everyone is free to use or modify without any cost or restriction.
We want to bring the solutions we are offering to the next step. By participating in this fundraiser you'll be part of the improvements we'll put into our educational software so kids can have better tools for school; our office suite so we have the best tools for the workplace; and our desktop so we can all experience a fun and productive experience when interacting with our computers.
Donating to KDE is not for you it is for the entire world.
The Other submenu allows you to select Path Link Destination Copied From Permissions Owner or User Group.
If Preview is enabled the icons are based on the actual file or folder contents; eg; for images a scaled down preview of the image is shown.
If Split is clicked two views are shown which can display the contents of different folders. This can be convenient for moving or copying files.
Selecting Items in the View
There are several ways to select items in the view. Once a group of items is selected all actions such as Cut Copy Move to Trash and drag and drop operations affect all selected items.
Enabling Switch between split panes with tab key allows to switch split views with the Tab; key.
Disable Turning off split view closes active pane to close the inactive pane when you are turning off the split view mode eg; pressing F3.
Previews Tab
In this tab you can configure for which file types previews are shown. Moreover the maximum size of remote files for which previews are generated can be chosen.
If previews are enabled for folders previews of some files in the folder will be shown inside a folder's icon.
 Ctrl;X  Edit Cut
Cuts the currently selected item(s).
 Ctrl;C  Edit Copy
Copies the currently selected item(s).

Welcome to kde;!
This guide will introduce you to the many features of the plasma; workspace and applications and describe many common tasks you can perform.
For more information visit kde; on MacOS;X.
BSD;
Most BSD; distributions allows you to install kde; applications and the plasma-desktop; through their ports system.
For more information on installing ports see your BSD; distribution's documentation.
Mobile Devices
To display all files enter a single asterisk (*).
The filter entry saves the last 10 filters entered between sessions. To use one press the arrow button on the right of the entry and select the desired filter string. You can disable the filter by pressing the Clear text button to the left of the autocompletion arrow button.
When saving a file the Filter entry will instead display a drop down box that allows you to select from all the file types the application supports. Select one to save a file in that format.
When saving a file this check box will appear. When selected (the default) the application will automatically append the default file extension for the selected file type to the end of the file name if it does not already appear in the Name entry. The file extension that will be used is listed in parenthesis at the end of the check box label.
The File Save Window
Red/Green/Blue
The lower-right corner of the screen also allows you to manually enter the coordinates of the desired color in the Red/Green/Blue (RGB) color model. For more information on this see the RGB color model article on Wikipedia.
HTML; Hexadecimal Code
You may enter the HTML; hexadecimal code representing the color in the lower-right corner of the screen. For more information on this see the Web colors article on Wikipedia.
This value is also updated when selecting a color by other methods so it always accurately represents the currently selected color.
FileSave As
Saves the file with a new filename.
FileSave All
Saves all open files.

Moving Around
The shortcuts described in Working With Windows Leaving Your Computer Changing Volume and Brightness and Working with Activities and Virtual Desktops are called global shortcuts since they work regardless of which window you have open on your screen. These can be modified in the Global Shortcuts panel of systemsettings; where they are separated by kde; component.
The shortcuts described Working with the Desktop are immutable and cannot be modified.
The shortcuts described in Working with Documents and Getting Help are set by individual programs. Most kde; programs allow you to use the common shortcut editing dialog to modify these. The shortcuts described in Working With Files can be edited in the same manner when used inside a file manager like dolphin; or konqueror; but cannot be modified in the case of Open/Save dialogs etc;
Technologies
The data storage access mechanism for all PIM (Personal Information Manager) data in kde; SC 4. One single storage and retrieval system allows efficiency and extensibility not possible under kde; 3 where each PIM component had its own system. Note that use of Akonadi does not change data storage formats (vcard iCalendar mbox maildir etc.) - it just provides a new way of accessing and updating the data.newpara; The main reasons for design and development of Akonadi are of technical nature eg; having a unique way to access PIM-data (contacts calendars emails..) from different applications (eg; kmail; kword; etc;) thus eliminating the need to write similar code here and there.newpara; Another goal is to de-couple GUI applications like kmail; from the direct access to external resources like mail-servers - which was a major reason for bug-reports/wishes with regard to performance/responsiveness in the past.newpara; More infonewpara; linkstart;"https//community.kde.org/KDEPIM/Akonadi"linkmid;Akonadi for KDE's PIMlinkend;newpara; linkstart;"https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akonadi"linkmid;Wikipedia Akonadilinkend;newpara; linkstart;"https//techbase.kde.org/KDEPIM/Akonadi"linkmid;Techbase - Akonadilinkend;

MIME;-Types
Abbreviation for emstart;Memend;ultipurpose (or Multimedia) emstart;Iemend;nternet emstart;Memend;ail emstart;Eemend;xtensions; MIME;-Types were first used to allow the transport of binary data (like mail attachments containing graphics) over mail connections that were normally only transmitting ASCII characters the data had to be encoded into an ASCII representation.newpara; Later this concept was extended to describe a data format in a platform independent but at the same time non-ambiguous way. From Windows; everybody knows the .doc extensions for Microsoft; Word files. This is handled ambiguously on the Windows; platform .doc extensions are also used for simple text files or for Adobe Framemaker files. And if a real Word file is renamed with a different extension it can no longer be opened by the program.newpara; MIME; typed files carry a recognition string with them describing their file format based on emstart;maincategory/subcategoryemend;. Inside IPP print files are also described using the MIME; type scheme. MIME; types are registered with the IANA (Internet Assigning Numbers emstart;Associationemend;) to keep them unambiguous.newpara; CUPS; has some MIME; types of its own registered like emstart;application/vnd.cups-rasteremend; (for the CUPS;-internal raster image format).

The variables listed here documents kappname; version 5.38. More variables may be added in the future. There are 3 possible types of values for variables with the following valid expressions
BOOL - on|off|true|false|1|0
INTEGER - any integer number
STRING - anything else
Available Variables
A C++ function rendered with syntax highlighting.
The same C++ function without highlighting.
Of the two examples which is easiest to read?
kappname; comes with a flexible configurable and capable system for doing syntax highlighting and the standard distribution provides definitions for a wide range of programming scripting and markup languages and other text file formats. In addition you can provide your own definitions in simple XML; files.
kappname; will automatically detect the right syntax rules when you open a file based on the MIME; Type of the file determined by its extension or if it has none the contents. Should you experience a bad choice you can manually set the syntax to use from the ToolsHighlighting  menu.
Default Styles were already explained as a short summary Default styles are predefined font and color styles.
General default styles
dsNormal when no special highlighting is required.
dsKeyword built-in language keywords.
dsFunction function calls and definitions.
lt;keyword String=quot;(list name)quot; (common attributes) /gt;
The String attribute identifies the keyword list by name. A list with that name must exist.
The highlighting system processes keyword rules in a very optimized way. This makes it an absolute necessity that any keywords to be matched need to be surrounded by defined delimiters either implied (the default delimiters) or explicitly specified within the additionalDeliminator property of the keywords tag.
If a keyword to be matched shall contain a delimiter character this respective character must be added to the weakDeliminator property of the keywords tag. This character will then loose its delimiter property in all keyword rules.
Detect an integer number (as the regular expression \b[0-9]+).
To extend the standard scripting API with your own functions and prototypes simply create a new file in kde;'s local configuration folder $XDGDATAHOME/katepart5/libraries and include it into your script using
require ("myscriptnamehere.js");
To extend existing prototypes like Cursor or Range the recommended way is to not modify the global *.js files. Instead change the Cursor prototype in JavaScript after the cursor.js is included into your script via require.
Cursors and Ranges
As kappname; is a text editor all the scripting API is based on cursors and ranges whenever possible. A Cursor is a simple (line column) tuple representing a text position in the document. A Range spans text from a starting cursor position to an ending cursor position. The API is explained in detail in the next sections.
String document.commentEnd(int attribute);
Returns the comment marker for the end of multi-line comments for a given attribute.
Returns a range that encompasses the whole document.
Cursor documentEnd();
Returns a cursor positioned at the last column of the last line in the document.

The kappname; editor is the editing area of the kappname; window. This editor is shared between kate; and kwrite; and it can also be used in konqueror; for displaying text files from your local computer or from the network.
The editor is composed of the following components
The editing area
This is where the text of your document is located.
The Scrollbars
All the indent modes use the indentation related settings in the active document.
You can set all sorts of configuration variables including those related to indentation using Document Variables and File types.
Available Autoindent Modes
Selecting this mode turns automatic indenting off entirely.
This indenter simply keeps the indentation similar to the previous line with any content other than whitespace. You can combine this with using the indent and unindent actions for indenting to your own taste.
A lookahead assertion is a sub pattern starting with either ?= or ?!.
For example to match the literal string Bill but only if not followed by  Gates you could use this expression Bill(?! Gates). (This would find Bill Clinton as well as Billy the kid but silently ignore the other matches.)
Sub patterns used for assertions are not captured.

This is a most useful feature. Right clicking on the name or icon of any file or folder not only selects that item but also brings up a menu allowing you to Cut Move Copy or Remove the item in various ways open it with the program of your choice or preview it rename it or edit the file type or properties.
On the Status Bar
The Apply to All button can be used if you have copied multiple items.
If Show selection marker is enabled in the Behavior tab of the File Management General section of the settings a small + or - button appears in the top left corner of the item which is currently hovered over with the mouse. Clicking this sign selects or deselects the item respectively.
If an arrow key PgUp PgDn Home or End is pressed the new current item is selected and the previous selection is cleared.
Selecting Items Using the Menu
You sometimes want to delete copy or move a number of files that are similar in some way. For example you may wish to move all of the .png graphics files from one folder to another. konqueror; makes this easy by letting you select multiple files based on similarities in their file names.
If you right click on a link (which may be a picture) and select Save Link As from the pop up menu the basic HTML; or similar source text will be downloaded and saved on your local disk.
Right clicking on a link (which may be a picture) and choosing Copy Link Address will copy the URL; of the link to the clipboard so you can then paste it into say an e-mail to a friend telling her about this wonderful new site.
Right clicking on a picture and choosing Copy Image copies the URL; of the picture to the clipboard.
Printing a copy of the page you are viewing is easily done with the Menubar File Print or Print Frame option or with the Toolbar Print button.

Item Drawing Options
In fsview; an item of the tree map visualization is a rectangle representing a file or folder of your file system. For easier navigation rectangles have meaningful coloring and labeling options.
The color of a rectangle switchable via menu item ViewColor Mode can be either representative of Depth for easy detection of nesting or a color mapping of different file attributes such as name owner group or mime type.
A rectangle can be labeled with the various attributes of the corresponding file or folder. For each attribute you can choose whether it should be shown at all only if space is available or if space should be taken from children (thus introducing errors to pure tree map drawing constraints). Additionally you can choose the relative location of the label in the rectangle.

In the first row click on the cell in the Field Caption column and enter Name as field caption. Filling the Field Caption field automatically fills the Name field as seen in the Property Editor pane.
Notes about field names and captions
The fields you inserted have no data source assigned yet so these are not able to display information from the database. To assign data source use the      (Data Source) tab of the Property Editor pane.
The very first step is to specify the form's data source ie; a place the displayed data will be fetched from. As mentioned above you will use table Persons as a data source for your new form.
Click on the form's surface as you will alter its properties.
Switch to the      (Data Source) tab and enter persons table name in the Form's data source drop down list. Alternatively you can select this name from the drop down list.
You have assigned form's data source. Now you need to do specify widget's data source.
Cut places the data/widget on the clipboard and removes it from it's current position.
Copy places the data/widget on the clipboard without removing it from it's current position.
Paste places the data/widget found on the clipboard to the table/object accordingly.
Paste Special is used to place arbitrary data found on the clipboard to a table in a way that is predictable so as to be correctly added according to the table's definition.
Find opens the Find dialog so as to search for specific text in the database data.

When constructing a spreadsheet you often need to include a series of values such as 10 11 12 in a row or column. There are several ways you can do this in sheets;.
For a simple short series such as 5 6 7 8 the Drag and Copy  method is the simplest. Enter the starting value into the starting cell and the next value of the series into an adjacent cell. Then select both cells and move the mouse pointer so that it is over the small square at the bottom right corner; the cursor will change to a diagonal double headed arrow. Then hold the left mouse button down while you drag the cells down or across as needed.
The step size is calculated as the difference between the two starting values that you have entered. For example if you enter 4 into cell A1 and 3.5 into A2 then select both cells and Drag and Copy them down the step size will be the value in A2 minus the value in A1 -0.5 in this case so you will get the series 4 3.5 3 2.5 2
The Drag and Copy method will even cope with series where the step value is not a constant value but is itself a series. So that if you start with 1 3 4 6 Drag and Copy will extend it to 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 12 the step value in this example being the series 2 1 2 1
sheets; also recognizes some special series such as the days of the week. Try entering Friday into a cell (note the capitalization) then Drag and Copy it down. To see what special series are available and perhaps create your own select Tools Custom Lists
Validity Checking
sheets; can automatically check the validity of entered data against a number of criteria and pop up a message box if the data is invalid.
To enable this feature select the cell(s) to be monitored and choose DataValidity . This will bring up sheets;'s Validity dialog box which has three tabbed pages.
In the Criteria page select what type of data is to be considered valid from the Allow combo box list then define the valid range of values by choosing one of the options in the Data combo box and entering suitable value(s) into one or both of the edit box(es).
When you have done this change to the Error Alert tab. Here you can choose the type of message box (Stop Warning or Information) that will appear when an invalid value is entered and define the message box title and message text.
You can also select an area of cells by selecting the cell in one corner of the wanted area then holding the Shift;  key down while using the left mouse button to select the cell in the opposite corner.
To select non-contiguous cells click on the first cell you want to select then hold the Ctrl; key and select the other cells.
To select a complete row or column of cells left  click on the row number at the left of the worksheet or on the column letters at the top. To select adjacent rows or columns drag the mouse pointer over the appropriate row numbers or column letters with the left button held down.
To select non-contiguous rows or columns of cells click on the first row number or column letter then hold the Ctrl; key and select the other rows or columns of cells.

The color indices like the magnitude scale run backward. Hot and blue stars have smaller and negative values of B-V than the cooler and redder stars.
An Astronomer can then use the color indices for a star after correcting for reddening and interstellar extinction to obtain an accurate temperature of that star. The relationship between B-V and temperature is illustrated in Figure 2.
The Sun with surface temperature of 5800 K has a B-V index of 0.62.

The Celestial Sphere
The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of gigantic radius centered on the Earth. All objects which can be seen in the sky can be thought of as lying on the surface of this sphere.
Of course we know that the objects in the sky are not on the surface of a sphere centered on the Earth so why bother with such a construct? Everything we see in the sky is so very far away that their distances are impossible to gauge just by looking at them. Since their distances are indeterminate you only need to know the direction toward the object to locate it in the sky. In this sense the celestial sphere model is a very practical model for mapping the sky.
The directions toward various objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing a Celestial Coordinate System.

The V-shaped curve displays absolute position versus Half-Flux-Radius (HFR) values. The center of the V-curve is the optimal focus position. Once Ekos crosses from one side of the V-curve to the other it backtracks and tries to find the optimal focus position. The final focus position is decided by which algorithm is selected.
When framing the horizontal axis denotes the frame number. This is to aid you in the framing process as you can see how HFR changes between frames.
Focus Relative Profile
The relative profile is a graph that displays the relative HFR values plotted against each other. Lower HFR values correspond to narrower shapes and vice-versa. The solid red curve is the profile of the current HFR value while the dotted green curve is for the previous HFR value. Finally the magenta curve denotes the first measured HFR and is displayed when the autofocus process concludes. This enables you to judge how well the autofocus process improved the relative focus quality.

Elliptical galaxies are spheroidal concentrations of billions of stars that resemble Globular Clusters on a grand scale. They have very little internal structure; the density of stars declines smoothly from the concentrated center to the diffuse edge and they can have a broad range of ellipticities (or aspect ratios). They typically contain very little interstellar gas and dust and no young stellar populations (although there are exceptions to these rules). Edwin Hubble referred to Elliptical galaxies as early-type galaxies because he thought that they evolved to become Spiral Galaxies (which he called late-type galaxies). Astronomers actually now believe the opposite is the case (ie; that Spiral galaxies can turn into Elliptical galaxies) but Hubble's early- and late-type labels are still used.

The magnitude scale runs backwards to what you might expect brighter stars have smaller magnitudes than fainter stars).
The modern magnitude scale is a quantitative measurement of the flux of light coming from a star with a logarithmic scaling
m = m0 - 2.5 log (F / F0)
If you do not understand the math this just says that the magnitude of a given star (m) is different from that of some standard star (m0) by 2.5 times the logarithm of their flux ratio. The 2.5 *log factor means that if the flux ratio is 100 the difference in magnitudes is 5 mag. So a 6th magnitude star is 100 times fainter than a 1st magnitude star. The reason Hipparchus's simple classification translates to a relatively complex function is that the human eye responds logarithmically to light.
There are several different magnitude scales in use each of which serves a different purpose. The most common is the apparent magnitude scale; this is just the measure of how bright stars (and other objects) look to the human eye. The apparent magnitude scale defines the star Vega to have magnitude 0.0 and assigns magnitudes to all other objects using the above equation and a measure of the flux ratio of each object to Vega.

End of the Tour
This concludes the tour of kstars; although we have only scratched the surface of the available features. kstars; includes many useful astronomy tools it can directly control your telescope and it offers a wide variety of configuration and customization options. In addition this Handbook includes the AstroInfo Project a series of short interlinked articles explaining some of the celestial and astrophysical concepts behind kstars;.
Retrograde Motion is the orbital motion of a body in a direction opposite that which is normal to spatial bodies within a given system.
The field of view is the angle covered on the sky by the telescope.The apparent field of view of a telescope is determined only by the eyepiece. It is a specific characteristic of it usually around 52 degrees. In order to find the true field of view of a telescope you need to divide the apparent field of view by the magnification. The true field of view is the actual angle covered on the sky by the telescope.
kstars; has a tool to find and display (on the virtual sky) a true field of view called the FOV Indicator. Launch it by heading under the Settings FOV SymbolsEdit FOV Symbols. Clicking New will open a dialog with four different tabs Eyepiece Camera Binocular and Radiotelescope. To compute the field of view select the tab that applies and enter the specifications of the equipment. Finally clicking Compute FOV will calculate and display the field of view immediately below. kstars; can now also display this as a shape of that size on the virtual sky. To do so enter a name for this particular field of view (such as 20mm eyepiece or DSLR with refractor) and select a shape and color to be displayed. For Eyepiece use Circle or Semitransparent circle as the shape since an eyepiece's field is round. For Camera use Square (which is actually a rectangle) assuming the sensor or film is rectangular or square. When using multiple eyepieces and/or telescopes it is good to distinguish them with different colors. Click OK to close the dialog. To show the shape on the screen go back under the Settings FOV Symbols menus then select the new menu item with the name of whatever it was given. To disable it again click the menu item again.
Types of Telescopes
As telescopes are used in observations over the entire electromagnetic spectrum they are classified in Optical Telescopes Ultraviolet Gamma Ray X-Ray Infrared and Radio Telescopes. Each one of them has its own well defined role in obtaining a detailed analysis of a celestial object.

Where to find camera profiles
So where do we get these elusive and oh-so-necessary camera-specific profiles that we need to translate our interpolated raw files to a working color space? The UFRAW website  section on color management has a bit of information on where to find ready-made camera profiles. It's an unfortunate fact of digital imaging that the camera profiles supplied by Canon Nikon and the like don't work as well with raw converters other than each camera manufacturer's own proprietary raw converter. Which is why Bibble and Phase One (and Adobe but ACR hides the Adobe-made profiles inside the program code) for example have to make their own profiles for all the cameras that they support - keep this proprietary propensity of your camera manufacturer in mind next time you buy a digital camera.
But back to finding a camera profile for your camera - the real answer (assuming you don't find a ready-made profile that makes you happy) is to make your own camera profile or have one made for you. There are quite a few commercial services who provide profiling services (for a fee of course). Or you can use LPRof or Argyll to profile your camera yourself. I haven't yet walked down that road so I cannot speak about how easy or difficult the process of profiling a camera might be. But I would imagine knowing how very meticulous the people behind Argyll LPRof and lcms are about color management that making your own camera profile is very do-able and very likely the results will be better than any proprietary profile. After all Canon (and also Bibble and Phase One for that matter) didn't profile MY camera - they just profiled a camera like mine.
Working Spaces
So now your raw file has been interpolated by dcraw and you've obtained a camera profile and used lcms tifficc to apply your camera profile to the tiff produced by dcraw (or you've asked dcraw to apply it for you). What does all this mean? The real answer involves a lot of math and color science that goes way over my head and likely yours. The short practical answer is that neither the camera profile space nor the Profile Connection Space is an appropriate space for image editing. Your next step is to choose a working space for image editing. And then you (or rather the lcms color management engine that your open source digital imaging software uses) actually perform a double translation. First lcms uses the camera profile to translate the RGB values of each pixel in the dcraw-output-image-without-camera-profile-applied into the aforementioned Profile Connection Space. Then it translates the RGB values of each pixel from the PCS to your chosen working space.
Well this is Linux; and it depends on where you put them. I put all my icc profiles in the /usr/share/color/icc folder which is the closest there is at this moment to a standard Linux location for icc profiles. If you use this folder for your icc profiles likely you will need to change permissions on the folder to allow your user read/write access. Then you just tell digikam; where your profiles are located.
Does the lighting and wall/ceiling/drape/furniture colors near my monitor matter?
Yes! Good lighting is a prerequisite for proper image editing and for comparing prints to the image on your screen. If the lighting near your workstation is too bright colors on your monitor look too dark and conversely. If the light from the fixtures in your workroom have a low CRI (color rendering index meaning you don't have full spectrum bulbs) or if the light in your workroom comes from a window and so varies as the weather and time of day varies (or worse is filtered through colored drapery) or if the walls and ceiling are creating color casts on your monitor then your editing process will "correct" color casts that don't really exist. Best advice as far as is consistent with maintaining harmony in the family neutral grey walls and ceiling cover the windows wear neutral clothing set appropriate light levels using appropriate bulbs and fixtures. For more information on what are the appropriate light levels bulbs and fixtures for editing images and viewing prints see the following articles
The Profiles Point to Real Colors in the Real World
Camera scanner working space monitor printer - what do all these color profiles really do?
sRGB uses a transfer function close to that of a CRT (and thus not necessarily relevant to image editing or to display on an LCD). As Wikipedia notes "Unlike most other RGB color spaces the sRGB gamma can not be expressed as a single numerical value. The overall gamma is approximately 2.2 consisting of a linear (gamma 1.0) section near black and a non-linear section elsewhere involving a 2.4 exponent and a gamma (slope of log output versus log input) changing from 1.0 through about 2.3" (cited from this page) which makes for some complicated math during image processing.
L*-RGB uses as its transfer function the same perceptually uniform transfer function as the CIELab color space. "When storing colors in limited precision values" using a perceptually uniform transfer function "can improve the reproduction of tones" (cited from this page).
In addition to gamma=1.8 and gamma=2.2 the only other gamma for a working space that gets much mention or use is linear gamma or gamma=1.0. As noted above dcraw outputs linear gamma files if you ask for 16-bit output. Linear gamma is used in HDR (high dynamic range) imaging and also if one wants to avoid introducing gamma-induced errors into one's regular low dynamic range editing.
"Gamma-induced errors" is a topic outside the scope of this tutorial. But see "Gamma errors in picture scaling" (cited from this page) for gamma-induced tonality shifts; and of course see Timo Autiokari's informative (albeit somewhat infamous) website for a whole-hearted endorsement of using linear gamma working spaces (Timo's website seems to be down at present though archived copies of his articles are still available through google). Bruce Lindbloom mentions a commonly-encountered gamma-induced error that is caused by incorrectly calculating luminance in a nonlinear RGB working space (see this page sidenote 1). And in a similar vein the calculations involved in mixing colors together to produce new colors (such as using a digital filter to add warmth to an image) result in gamma errors unless the new colors are calculated by first transforming all the relevant values back to their linear values.
Unfortunately and despite their undeniable mathematical advantages linear gamma working spaces have so few tones in the shadows that (in my opinion) they are impossible to use for editing if one is working in 8-bits and still problematic at 16-bits. When the day comes when we are all doing our editing on 32-bit files produced by our HDR cameras on our personal supercomputers I predict that we will all be using working spaces with gamma=1. Adobe Lightroom is already using a linear gamma working space "under the hood" CS2 allows the option of using linear gamma for mixing colors and Lightzone has always used a linear gamma working space.
The Brightness Contrast Gamma Tool in Action
Another important tool is called ColorLevels Adjust. This tool provides an integrated way of seeing the results of adjusting multiple levels and also enables you to save level settings for application to multiple photographs. This can be useful if your camera or scanner often makes the same mistakes and you want to apply the same corrections. See the dedicated Adjust Levels manual for more information.
A very powerful way of correcting exposure problems is to use the Adjust Curves tool available by Color Curves Adjust menu entry.
The digikam; Adjust Levels is a tool to manually adjust the histogram channels of an image.
Situated between the more sophisticated Adjust Curves tool and the simpler Brightness/Contrast/Gamma Image Editor tool is this Adjust Levels tool for improving exposure. Although the dialog for this tool looks very complicated for the basic usage we have in mind here the only part you need to deal with is the Input Levels area concretely the 3 sliders that appear below the histogram.
The Add-border tool in action
The Add Border dialog tool in action is available below.

The digikam; Insert Text is a tool for adding text to an image.
This is a handy tool as it lets you add formatted text easily to an image wherever you want at several places when needed.
The Inpainting Advanced Settings
Angular Step da [5 90] angular integration of the anisotropy alpha. If alpha is chosen small da should also be chosen small. But beware small angles result in long runs! Choose it as large as you can accept.
Integral Step [0.1 10] spatial integration step width in terms of pixels. Should remain less than 1 (sub-pixel smoothing) and never be higher than 2.
Use Linear Interpolation The gain in quality if you select this option is only marginal and you lose a factor of 2 in speed. Our recommendation is to leave it off.
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any Photograph Inpainting filter settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem in a text file and loaded later.
Refocus Dialog
In most cases (blurring by camera) a circular convolution caused the image degradation but there are two convolutions available   The circular convolution this one spreads each source point uniformly across a small disk with a fixed radius. Technically this describes the effects of using a (ideal) lens that is not correctly focused.   The Gaussian convolution this one is mathematically similar to the normal distribution with its bell-shaped curve. Originates rather from unnatural blurring (software blurring). From a theoretical point of view the mathematical justification for using the Gaussian convolution is that when you a apply a large number of independent random convolutions the results will always approach a Gaussian convolution.   The refocus tool supports both the Circular and the Gaussian convolution plus mixtures of both.
In practice in most cases the Circular convolution works much better than the Gaussian convolution. The Gaussian convolution has a very long tail so mathematically the result of the convolution also depends on source pixels at a large distance from the original source pixel. The FIR Wiener inverse of a Gaussian convolution in most cases is heavily influenced by source pixels at a large distances and in most cases this produces undesirable results.
To set correctly the deconvolution filter the plug-in has the following parameters
Circular Sharpness This is the radius of the Circular convolution filter. It is the most important parameter for using the plug-in. With most images the default value of 1 should give good results. Select a higher value when your image is very blurred but beware of producing halos.
These are the distorting effects available

Rescaling an image to make it smaller is easy. The big question is how can you blow up an image and keep the details sharp? How can one zoom in when the resolution boundary has been reached? How can one reinvent or guess the missing information to fill in the necessarily coarse image after upsizing? Well the CImg algorithm we use here does an excellent job try it out and see for yourself!
Resizing a Photograph
If the photograph has the wrong size you can scale it to the size you would like by using Transform Resize tool. Select TransformResize and adjust the target values. The Resize tool dialog is available below.
The Resize Tool Dialog
This image resizing tool uses a standard linear interpolation method to approximate pixels. If you want to up-size a small image with a better quality try the Blowup tool.
Many old digital still cameras used Serial Port to communicate with host computers. Because photographs are big files and serial port transfers are slow this connection is now obsolete. digikam; supports these cameras and performs image transfers using the gPhoto2 program. You can find a complete list of supported digital cameras at this url.
libgphoto2 needs to be built with libexif to retrieve thumbnails to digiKam properly. EXIF support is required for thumbnail retrieval on some libgphoto2 camera drivers. If EXIF support is not set with libgphoto2 you might not see thumbnails or the thumbnail extraction may be very slow.
Transfers using Mass Storage device
For the devices that are not directly supported by gPhoto2 there is support for the Mass Storage protocol which is well supported under GNU;/Linux;. This includes many digital cameras and Memory Card Readers. Mass Storage interfaces are   USB Mass Storage a computer interface using communication protocols defined by the USB Implementers Forum that run on the Universal Serial Bus. This standard provides an interface to a variety of storage devices including digital cameras.   FireWire Mass Storage a computer interface using communication protocols developed primarily by Apple Computer in the 1990s. FireWire offers high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data services. Like USB Mass Storage this standard provides an interface to a variety of storage devices including digital still cameras. Almost all recent digital cameras support USB version 1 and eventually will support USB version 2; a very few support FireWire.   To use a generic Mass Storage device with digikam; select ImportCameraAdd Camera Manually add your device and set the correct mount point path.

Select your favorite e-mail client from the drop-down menu. Default is the current email program set in kde; systemsettings;.
If you select Attach a file with image properties from Application the comments rating or tags included with the images will be merged to a text file and attached in the mail.
The next three items allow you to set-up the image properties to be sent. To enable these options check Adjust image properties. First select an Image size suitable for your Internet connection speed and the target mailbox size.
The PNG format in the Image file format drop-down menu is not well adapted to reduce photographic images file size but is best suited for compressing lossless items like the TIFF file format. PNG must be used if you use dialup speed Internet and you want to preserve the photo quality. Otherwise JPEG is the recommended format.
If you choose JPEG as the Image file format and the original files were in JPEG format the original Exif data included is preserved in e-mailed images.
The organization should be simple unified and scalable and it should be independent of the storage medium on which you host them. Do not make the folders too small several thousand images in one folder is not too much to ask for but keep them small enough so that they can fit into a backup medium like a DVD or a Blue Ray. Remember that the archive will grow all the time! The concrete type of structure depends on your use case of course Lets take a simple yet frequent example you are a casual photographer taking pictures of your private life your family holidays and so on. It could be efficient to create a structure based on years plus some holiday and export containers. It could look like this
Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. Holiday pictures can be quickly found by its location (unless you go to the same place every year) the rest will be organized by date. If you shoot enough pictures you want to create sub folders below the years as months eg; 2008-01 2008-02 etc; 'Export' would be a container for images to print or to put onto a website.
The consideration are these
What kind of files go together? Segregation of file type makes batch processing easier. Keep new and old files separate.
How can you make that structure scalable?
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
While a surge suppressor will protect your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it won’t help you if the power should black out completely. Even an outage of just a few seconds can result in the loss of valuable data so you might find it worthwhile to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.
Besides serving as surge suppressors these devices automatically switch to battery power when a power outage occurs giving you the opportunity to save data and shut down your system. Some models will even allow you to keep working until power is restored. When purchasing a UPS be sure that it has the same qualities that you would seek in a surge suppressor but also check out the battery life and included software.
Considering the potential risk to your computing system ensuring its safety from power disturbances is a worthwhile investment. A quality surge suppressor will cost you upward of euro;20 a 500W UPS can be had for less than euro;40. It’s a small cost to pay for the peace of mind you’ll gain knowing your computer is well protected. In the very least pull all lines to your computer when you go on holidays.
Solid state drives USB sticks memory cards flash disks
That's probably one of the reasons why around 2001 that Adobe introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the quot;Image resource blockquot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for quot;Extensible Metadata Platformquot; a mixture of XML and RDF. It is a labeling technology that lets users embed data about a file in the file itself the file info is saved using the extensionquot;.xmpquot; (signifying the use of XML/RDF).
XMP. As much as ODF will be readable forever (since its containing text is written in clear text) XMP will preserve your metadata in a clearly understandable format XML. No danger here of not being able to read it later. It can be embedded into the image files or as a separate accompanying file (sidecar concept). XMP can be used in PDF JPEG JPEG2000 GIF PNG HTML TIFF Adobe Illustrator PSD PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript. In a typical edited JPEG file XMP information is typically included alongside Exif and IPTC data.
Embedding metadata in files allows easy sharing and transfer of files across products vendors platforms customers without metadata getting lost. The most common metadata tags recorded in XMP data are those from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative which include things like title description creator and so on. The standard is designed to be extensible allowing users to add their own custom types of metadata into the XMP data. XMP generally does not allow binary data types to be embedded. This means that any binary data one wants to carry in XMP such as thumbnail images must be encoded in some XML-friendly format such as Base64.
Many photographers prefer keeping an original of their shots (mostly RAW) for the archive. XMP suits that approach as it keeps metadata separate from the image file. I do not share this point of view. There could be problems linking metadata file and image file and as said above RAW formats will become obsolete. I recommend using DNG as a container and putting everything inside.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization engaged in the development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling discussions and collaborative work in DCMI Communities and DCMI Task Groups annual conferences and workshops standards liaison and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.
The content of the Tool Tips can be configured in the Tool Tip section of  Settings Configure digikam; 
As an alternative you can display the photographs in a table by hitting the Table button on the Main Toolbar or by selecting ViewTable menu from the menu bar. This allows to see a lot of photographs at the same time (Tip leave away the thumbnail column) in a way you can customize the usual way by click with the RMB; on the headline bar and choose the information you want to see. Clicking with the LMB; on a line in the table will open the preview of that photograph.
You can access most of the functions that digikam; can perform on a photograph by click with the RMB; over the thumbnail or line in the table (context menu) or by selecting from the Item menu in the menu bar.
Viewing an image
There are several possibilities to view an image. You can either click on it select  F3 ViewPreview Image  from the menu bar or select Preview Image from the context menu. The Preview Area will open and the Icon Area will be reduced to one line. For viewing it larger click the sidebars away (by just clicking on the active button on them). An even larger view you can achieve by clicking the Show Fullscreen icon     either on the thumbnail or on the preview. While viewing images you can take action from the context menu at any time (not in fullscreen mode). To close the preview just click again or press Esc; or F3 or click the Table or Thumbnails button.

You can save your searches as a live folder that always filters for what you entered as search criteria. Just type a name for the search into the Save Current Search field and click the save button to the right of it. When saved the filter will appear in the Searches list. By clicking the title bar of this list you can invert the sorting order. Once you select one of your saved searches the search result will be presented in the Image Area immediately and the Save Current Search field will convert into a Edit Stored Search field where you can edit your search criteria. The name of the saved search will be used to label the search result in the Image Area.
If you want to delete or rename a saved search from the list click with the RMB; on it and select from the context menu.

Before HTML; pages are generated you need to specify a bit of information split over the three pages Content Layout and Destination. The following section describes each page in detail.
The Content page
In the content page you specify which information should be generated to the HTML; pages.
HTML Generator Content Configuration
First you specify the title of the overview pages plus a description generated on these pages. If the theme you selected supports copyright notice this can also be specified here.
You can specify a property from a list box simply by selecting it (Select say Donna to specify that Donna is on the given image. Alternatively you may type its name in the line edit. When you start typing a name in the line edit kphotoalbum; will look into the listbox and search for the first item matching what you've typed so far and fill it out. Thus typing Do might be enough to find Donna. Once you have found the item you search for simply press enter to select this item in the listbox. The item will now be moved to the top of the view so next time you need the given item it is even easier to find. There is also a "seamless" way of annotating from Image Viewer that is described later on in .
The idea behind moving items to the top when they have been selected is that when going to say a family party you will get perhaps 50 images all with the same 5-10 people. When typing in information about these 50 images you will have the 5-10 people at the top of the listbox as soon as you have typed in their name the first time.
If you prefer to have the list alphabetically sorted instead simply press the icon for sorting under the list box.
Annotating one item at a time
When you specify properties for one image at a time you may still of course select a number of images and say I want to annotate these images. In this situation you will find a next and previous button under the image in the topmost rightmost corner.
Save the new image somewhere under kphotoalbum;'s image directory and run MaintenanceRescan for Images and Videos. This should notice the new panorama and include it in the picture gallery.
If you have set the AutoStacking of new images properly and name of the new panorama matches the rules for this the panorama should be on top of the stack. Otherwise sort the images by date so the new panorama ends up at by the source images and stack them manually. (Autopano Pro seems to write the EXIF info of the first image into the panorama.)
You can still add tagging at this point to the panorama or you might include all the source images also with Ctrl;2.
KXStitch User's Manual
Eric Pareja First version of KXStitch man page for Debian project. xenos@upm.edu.ph
kdevelop; has the concept of sessions and projects. A session contains all projects that have something to do with each other. For the examples that follow assume you are the developer of both a library and an application that uses it. You can think of the core KDE libraries as the former and kdevelop; as the latter. Another example Let's say you are a Linux; kernel hacker but you are also working on a device driver for Linux; that hasn't been merged into the kernel tree yet.
So taking the latter as an example you would have a session in kdevelop; that has two projects the Linux; kernel and the device driver. You will want to group them into a single session (rather than having two sessions with a single project each) because it will be useful to be able to see the kernel functions and data structures in kdevelop; whenever you write source code for the driver mdash; for example so that you can get kernel function and variable names auto-expanded or so that you can see kernel function documentation while hacking on the device driver.
Now imagine you also happen to be a KDE developer. Then you would have a second session that contains KDE as a project. You could in principle have just one session for all of this but there is no real reason for this in your KDE work you don't need to access kernel or device driver functions; and you don't want KDE class names autoexpanded while working on the Linux; kernel. Finally building some of the KDE libraries is independent of re-compiling the Linux; kernel (whereas whenever you compile the device driver it would also be good to re-compile the Linux; kernel if some of the kernel header files have changed).
Finally another use for sessions is if you work both on the current development version of a project as well as on a branch in that case you don't want kdevelop; to confuse classes that belong to mainline and the branch so you'd have two sessions with the same set of projects but from different directories (corresponding to different development branches).
Setting up a session and importing an existing project
Selecting NavigationJump to definition (or hitting Ctrl;).
Selecting NavigationPrevious visited context (or hit MetaLeft) as described below.
Jumping to the declaration of a symbol is something that does not only work when placing the cursor on the name of the function you are currently implementing. Rather it also works for other symbols Putting the cursor on a (local global or member) variable and jumping to its declaration also transports you to its location of declaration. Similarly you can place the cursor on the name of a class for example in a variable of function declaration and jump to the location of its declaration.
Switch between declaration/definition In the example above to jump to the site of the declaration of the current function you need to first place the cursor on the function name. To avoid this step you can select NavigationSwitch definition/declaration (or hit Shift;Ctrl;C) to jump to the declaration of the function within which the cursor currently is. Selecting the same menu entry a second time transports you back to the place where the function is defined.
Previous/Next use Placing the cursor on the name of a local variable and selecting NavigationNext use (or hitting MetaShift;Right) transports you to the next use of this variable in the code. (Note that this doesn't just search for the next occurrence of the variable name but in fact takes into account that variables with the same name but in different scopes are different.) The same works for the use of function names. Selecting NavigationPrevious use (or hitting MetaShift;Left) transports you to the previous use of a symbol.
Even though most testing frameworks require each test to also be a class kdevelop; includes a method to simplify the creation of unit tests. To create a new test right click on a project folder and choose Create from Template. In the template selection page choose Test as the category then choose your programming language and template and click Next.
You will be prompted for the test name and a list of test cases. For the test cases you only have to specify a list of names. Some unit testing frameworks such as PyUnit and PHPUnit require that test cases start with a special prefix. In kdevelop; the template is responsible for adding the prefix so you do not have to prefix the test cases here. After clicking Next specify the license and output locations for the generated files and the test will be created.
Unit tests created this way will not be added to any target automatically. If you are using CTest or some other testing framework make sure to add the new files to a target.
While classes and unit tests receive special attention when generating code from templates the same method can be used for any kind of source code files. For example one could use a template for a CMake Find module or a .desktop file. This can be done by choosing Create from Template and selecting the wanted category and template. If the selected category is neither Class nor Test you will only have the option of choosing the license any custom options specified by the template and the output file locations. As with classes and tests finishing the assistant will generate the files and open them in the editor.

Clicking this button does not discard the changes you have made. It merely means you do not wish to connect to any networks at this time.
When you click the New button the New Network screen appears.
Enter the Network name here. You may create as many entries in the Server List screen with the same Network as you like.
Choose an existing Identity or click the Edit button to add a new Identity or edit an existing one. The Identity will identify you and determine your i18n-nickname; when you connect to the network.
Optional. This command will be sent to the server after connecting. Example /msg NickServ IDENTIFY konvirocks. This example is for the freenode network which requires users to register their i18n-nickname; with a password and login when connecting. konvirocks is the password for the i18n-nickname; given in Identity. You may enter more than one command by separating them with semicolons.
The irc; network is recorded because i18n-nickname;s are unique across a single irc; network. The i18n-nickname; in two different irc; networks is not necessarily the same person but the same i18n-nickname; on two different servers within the same irc; network generally is the same person.
This is why it is important to use the same Network for all servers in the same irc; network when  defining networks servers and auto join channels.
To activate the i18n-nickname; watching feature choose  Window Watched Nicks  on the main menu. The Watched Nicks screen will appear.
Watched Nicks.
The i18n-nickname;s in your watch list are listed here. They are listed under their associated irc; network. If no i18n-nickname;s are listed either you haven't specified any i18n-nickname;s to watch or you need to activate the i18n-nickname; watching feature (see below). Expand each online i18n-nickname; to see a list of channels the i18n-nickname; has joined. The icons next to each channel are the same as the icons that appear in the Nick Panel in the channel screens.
To make the Maker Line be inserted in all channels and queries at once choose  Settings Configure Konversation  from the main menu expand Behavior click on Chat Window and check the Show manually inserted lines in all chat windows box.
To make konversation; automatically insert a Marker Line whenever you do an /away msg command see Setting your identity.
If logging is enabled konversation; keeps a log of each Server Channel and Private conversation (query) session. Each session is stored in a log file on disk. When you open the same session again konversation; appends to the log.
Whenever you open a session again approximately the last 1024 characters of the previous session are read from the tail of the log and shown on the screen.
As your session continues messages scroll off the top of the display. You can scroll backwards to view these messages. Eventually in order to conserve memory the oldest messages are discarded from the scroll. This is called the Scrollback limit. Messages that disappear from the display because of the Scrollback limit are still available in the log file if logging is enabled.
You can write your own scripts. Scripts are shell scripts and can be written in any shell language such as bash perl or python. When konversation; runs a script the first two parameters sent to the script are
The address of the server.
The channel name.
Here is a sample shell script (cmd).
Notice that the script uses qdbus to communicate with konversation;. The say command causes the output to be sent to the channel as a normal message. To display something in the tab without sending it to other users use info instead. Look at the existing script files for more examples of writing scripts.

By default rsync1 will delete any partially transferred file if the transfer is interrupted. In some circumstances it is more desirable to keep partially transferred files. Using the --partial option tells rsync1 to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.
Option --partial-dir=DIR
A better way to keep partial files than the --partial option is to specify a folder DIR that will be used to hold the partial data (instead of writing it out to the destination file). On the next transfer rsync1 will use a file found in this folder as data to speed up the resumption of the transfer and then delete it after it has served its purpose. Before you tick this option you should read the manual page.
Option --bwlimit=RATE
Set the maximum data transfer rate in kilobytes per second.

Video Collections
Video collections have 30 default fields Title Medium Production Year Certification Genre Region Nationality Format Cast Director Producer Writer Composer Studio Language Tracks Subtitle Languages Audio Tracks Running Time Aspect Ratio Widescreen Color Mode Director's Cut Plot Summary Personal Rating Purchase Date Purchase Price Gift Loaned Cover and Comments.
The Cast field is a table with two columns and the name of the actor is intended to be in the first column with their role in the second. The Running Time is meant to be in minutes though you can change that of course.
Music Collections
Music collections have 15 default fields Title Medium Artist Label Year Genre Tracks Rating Purchase Date Purchase Price Gift Loaned Keywords Cover and Comments.
A field is defined by its title type category description and possibly a default value or some allowed values. The title is used everywhere to refer to the field in the user interface. The Entry Editor uses it to prompt for values. The Column View uses it as a column header. The different types of fields are explained in the Field Types section. The description is used as a tooltip in the Entry Editor perhaps to provide an explanation of the field's contents. In addition for fields with derived values a value template is used to format the field's value. The default value is automatically added when creating a new entry. The list of allowed values for Choice fields should be separated by a semi-colon.
New fields may be any type but changing the type of existing fields is restricted to compatible types as shown in the table below
Allowable Field Type Changes
Current Type
New Type Allowed
The format of the field is given in the format attribute on the field element. Date Formatting is not currently used. Grouping by People uses all the fields which use Name Formatting. Setting the Derived Value flag implies the value for the field is generated from the template property from other field values.

version control system
kdesvn; is a subversion client by kde;.
You should have some knowledge about subversion itself but hopefully most items are self explanatory.
You may send bug reports and feature wishes via kde; Bugtracking System.
If you're familiar with revision control systems you may skip that - or read and correct the author ;)
Contains one or two regular expressions separated by a newline.
If only one expression is set then the bare bug ID's must be matched in the groups of the regex string. If two expressions are set then the first expression is used to find a string which relates to the bug ID but may contain more than just the bug ID (eg; Issue #123 or resolves issue 123). The second expression is then used to extract the bare bug ID from the string extracted with the first expression.
Please keep care about not wanted spaces after the regular expression and don't forget the brackets around the number description.

loggedaction
Subversion defined action string on item (AMD)
Check on working copies if an item has this property set and if yes displays a special overlayed icon. Setting this may let listings get real slow.
When checked kdesvn; get more detailed info about file items when making a listing to remote repositories. So you may see remote locks in overview. Be careful This may let listings REAL slow!
When activated info on folders will gain information about all items below may be real slow.
Storing passwords is often a security problem. Subversion stores its passwords into a flat file ie; passwords in the plain text! So be careful setting this flag and see next entry too. This item only says if saving passwords is the default you may change it for specific realms inside login dialog.
When saving passwords the plain text file from subversion is a security hole. kdesvn; is able saving them into encrypted kde; wallet instead there (starting with version 0.12.0) and use them. On other hand other subversion clients aren't able reading them so you must enter them if using tools like svn command line tool or rapidsvn too. As long as subversion does not encrypt password storage you should think twice about it.
Revert changes made in working copy and updates to last updated state.

Creating an extended partition
Click OK and the operation to create this extended partition is added to the list.
Now create a primary partition on the rest of the device where the new OS will be installed. Make it as large as the unallocated area in front of the extended partition
Creating a primary partition
Click OK in the dialog to accept your choice. The operation to create the new primary partition is then added to the operation list.
The command is only enabled if either an unallocated area is selected or a partition that is not currently mounted.
Restoring a partition on an existing one means that all data on the existing partition is destroyed and replaced with the data from the restored image file.
Partition Properties
Shows a partition's properties This command shows a dialog with information about the currently selected partition or unallocated space.
What is displayed and what can be modified in this dialog depends on the type of partition the type of the file system on the partition and on the partition being currently mounted or not.
See White-Space Differences At One Glance
Spaces and tabs that differ appear visibly. When lines differ only in the amount of white space this can be seen at one look in the summary column on the left side. (No more worries when people change the indentation.)
Triple-Diff
Analyze three files and see where they differ.
The left/middle/right windows are named A/B/C and have the blue/green/magenta color respectively.
kdiff3; offers automatic merge for these items at Merge item in the settings dialog. For simple lines that match the Auto merge regular expression option in all input-files kdiff3; will choose the line from B or - if available - from C. (Additionally it is necessary that the lines in question line up in the comparison and the previous line contains no conflict.) This auto merge can either be run immediately after a merge starts (activate the option Run regular expression auto merge on merge start) or later via MergeRun Regular Expression Auto Merge menu item.
Automatic merge for version control history (also called "log") is also supported. The history automerge can either run immediately when the merge starts by activating the option Merge version control history on merge start at Merge item in the settings dialog or later via the MergeAutomatically Solve History Conflicts menu item.
Usually the version control history begins with a line containing the keyword "#36;Log#36;". This must be matched by the History start regular expression option. kdiff3; detects which subsequent lines are in the history by analysing the leading characters that came before the "#36;Log#36;" keyword. If the same "leading comment" characters also appears in the following lines then they are also included in the history.
During each check-in the VCS writes a unique line specifying version- date- and time-information followed by lines with user comments. These lines form one history-entry. This history section grows with every check-in and the most recent entries appear at the top (after the history start line).
When for parallel development two or more developers check-in a branch of the file then the merge history will contain several entries that appear as conflicts during the merge of the branches. Since merging these can become very tedious kdiff3; offers support with two possible strategies Just insert the history information from both contributors at the top or sort the history information by a user defined key.
Above the codec-selectors appears this note that tells you what the local encoding is. (This is not adjustable but for your information just in case you don't know your local encoding but need to select it.)
File Encoding for A/B/C
Adjust the file encoding for input files. This has an effect on how the special characters are interpreted. Since you can adjust each codec separately you can even compare and merge files that were saved using different codecs.
When you have edited a file then you can adjust which encoding will be used when saving to disk.
When you define preprocessors then they might not be able to operate on your codec. (eg; Your files are 16 bit unicode and your preprocessor can only take 8 bit ASCII;.) With this option you can define the encoding of preprocessor output.
Compare/Merge three directories
When three directories are merged then dir1 is used as the base for the merge. If no destination directory is specified then kdiff3; will use dir3 as the destination directory for the merge.
Note that only the comparison starts automatically not the merge. For this you first must select a menu entry or the F7 key. (More details later.)
Directory Merge Visible Information
While reading the directories a message-box appears that informs you of the progress. If you abort the directory scan then only files that have been compared until then will be listed.
Do a full analysis of each file and show the statistics information columns. (Number of Solved Unsolved Nonwhite and White conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis and much slower when used on files that don't contain text. (Specify the appropriate file-antipatterns.)
If you compare big directories over a slow network it might be faster to compare the modification dates and file length alone. But this speed improvement comes with the price of a little uncertainty. Use this option with care. Default is off.
Similar to trusting the modification date. No real comparison happens. Two files are considered equal if their file-sizes are equal. This is useful when the file-copy operation didn't preserve the modification date. Use this option with care. Default is off.
Activates sync-mode when two directories are compared and no explicit destination directory was specified. In this mode the proposed operations will be chosen so that both source directories are equal afterwards. Also the merge result will be written to both directories. Default is off.
Instead of merging the proposed operation will copy the newer source if changes happened. (Considered unsafe because it implies that you know that the other file hasn't been edited too. Check to make sure in every case.) Default is off.

Queue manager
The copy move pack and unpack operations can be queued. After selecting copy or move hit F2 to use it. After selecting pack or unpack hit F2 to use it. Or the direct shortcuts copy by queue Shift;F5  move by queue Shift;F6 . Queue manager performs actions one-by-one. For example if you have a pen drive (which is slow) and you want to copy 40 files onto it it is much better copying them one-by-one instead of starting to copy 40 files in parallel. That is why enqueuing is important. If you pack/unpack 40 files in parallel you overload your computer but adding them to a queue is much more useful.
It is possible to switch the Queue Manager mode by the Settings Job Queue Mode menu item.
Deleting - move to plasma; Trash
Deleting files/directories is done by selecting them and pressing F8 or Delete. By default it will be moved to plasma; Trash. You can open the plasma; Trash with the Trash icon in the Main Toolbar or with the trash/ KIO slave. Physically plasma; Trash is located in /.local/share/Trash/ or Trash in the subdirectory in user home directory which can be determined using the qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation command. Shift; Delete will delete the file permanently. A dialog will ask for your confirmation and will warn you when deleting non-empty directories. Of course only operations that are permitted to do by the Operating System will be performed - you will be notified otherwise. If you do not wish to see the confirmation dialogs you can disable them in the Konfigurator advanced page.

OFM User Interface
The OFM file manager concept contains many features that make them powerful enough to belong among the best file managers today. The interface is simple left panel right panel and a command line below. Because of interaction between these three items the file managing will become more efficient.
If you would like to know  how krusader; works you can try it yourself just install it on your computer. To accept an Orthodox File Manager (OFM) like krusader; the user needs to get used to new ideas that are actually already 20 years old. If you prefer to waste time and lose a lot of productivity you can always continue to use one panel file managers that are based on Windows; Explorer.
With ActionMan you can set up configure and manage UserActions. Some general settings are configured with Konfigurator. With UserActions you can perform actions on files in the panel or to access krusader; internal functions with parameters directly using placeholders. The actions integrate seamlessly into plasma; action system which means that the standard Edit Toolbar and Edit Shortcut dialogs will show UserActions too. The UserActions are stored in  /.local/share/krusader/useractions.xml or krusader/useraction.xml in the directory which can be determined using the qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation command. Several examples are included in the documentation. UserActions can be edited / added / imported / exported by using ActionMan. The default UserActions are stored in  /usr/share/krusader/useraction-examples.xml. UserActions can appear nearly everywhere where normal KActions can be placed. The actions can even be placed in the menu bar but for that the krusaderui.rc file must be edited. A few examples

The traditional way to indicate that your computer is busy is to modify the cursor and you can turn this on by choosing a Cursor.
With this option enabled your cursor will have an icon attached to it for a short time when a new application is being launched. You can configure how long this icon is displayed beside your cursor with the Stop animation after spinbox. The default is 5 seconds.
There are several variations of busy cursor available including a Blinking a Bouncing or a Static cursor icon with no animation.
Traditional plasma; launch notification has taken another form which you can also enable and disable here. Normally when you start an application it gets an immediate entry in the taskbar with the icon replaced by a spinning hourglass to let you know something is happening. You can toggle this behavior on and off with the Enable animation checkbox.
Not all applications that you start will eventually show a window or an entry in the taskbar. Some of them for example are docked into the plasma; system tray. Alternatively it might be that you sent it off to a different virtual desktop and in the Filters section of the  Task Manager Settings the option Only show tasks from the current desktop is checked. Setting a timeout ensures that even in these cases you can still get launch feedback but also that it will go away when the job is done.
Standard shortcuts and Global shortcuts work just the same. Actually in a certain way standard or application shortcuts are global as well. The only difference is
Standard shortcuts refer to actions that are often available in applications such as Save Print Copy etc;
Global shortcuts are shortcuts for actions that make sense even when no application is opened. These shortcuts usually refer to actions like switching desktops manipulating windows etc;
Please note that the application shortcuts configured here are only the standard actions often found in applications. Most applications will define their own actions as well for which you have to customize key bindings using the application's key bindings dialog.
Standard Shortcuts page
Window actions contain several options
This configures the particular window action that must occur for the shortcut to be triggered. The following options are available
Window appears - Triggered when a window is opened.
Window disappears - Triggered when a window is closed.
Window gets focus - Triggered when you switch to a window.
To see a video preview of an effect click on the   button.
Some effects are mutual exclusive to other effects. For example one would only want to activate the Minimize Animations or the Magic Lamp effect. Both activated at the same time result in broken animations.
For effects in a mutual exclusive group the GUI; uses radio buttons and manages that only one of these effects can be activated.
All effects which are not supported by the currently used compositing backend are hidden by default (eg; OpenGL effects when using XRender).
Also all internal or helper effects are hidden by default. These are effects which replace functionality from KWin Core or provide interaction with other elements of the desktop shell.

Console Application
Application originally written for non-graphic text oriented environment. Such applications run fine in kde;. They must run within console emulator like konsole;. They are not warned automatically when you shut down your kde; session. You therefore must not forget to save documents open in these applications before you log out from the kde;.
Console applications support copying and pasting from kde;-compliant applications.Simply mark the text in the console application with your mouse switch to the kde;-compliant application and press Ctrl; V to paste the text. If you want to copy from kde; application to a console application first mark the text with your mouse press Ctrl; C switch to the console application and press the middle button on your mouseIf your mouse does not have a middle button you must press left and right button at the same time. This is called middle button emulation and it must be supported by your operating system to work..

After you have configured your custom worksheet use the splitter and move it to the right edge of the window to hide the sensor browser.
If the sensor browser does not appear on a custom worksheet it is probably hidden. To unhide it select the right edge of the window and drag it to the left.
Line Graph
The line graph prints samples of one or more sensors over time. If several sensors are displayed the values are piled in different colors. If the display is large enough a grid will be displayed to show the range of the plotted samples. By default the automatic range mode is active so the minimum and maximum values will be set automatically. Sometimes you want fixed minimum and maximum values. In that case you can deactivate automatic range mode and set the values in the properties dialog.
Digital Display
You can choose to view either all files or filter either by specific regular expressions (eg; all files with a certain extension) or by file type (eg; just images).
This widget also supports basic file management properties (moving copying cutting and pasting for example) and you can have as many as you want on your desktop.
If you select the layout Folder View in the Desktop Settings you can use one Folder View as the whole desktop effectively replicating the "old style" desktop paradigm.

On the right you can see a topographical map of our beautiful home planet. To allow for better orientation the map offers a scale bar in the lower left corner as well as a windrose on the top right. To navigate and to control the view you can use the tools on the Navigation info box at the right Press the arrow buttons to rotate the globe. The Up and Down arrow buttons will tilt the earth axis back and forth. The Left and Right arrow buttons will make the earth spin around its physical axis.
You can accomplish the same behavior by pressing the LMB; somewhere on the globe and by moving the mouse while keeping the LMB; pressed. Using this drag and drop style navigation will allow you to adjust the viewing angle much easier and more precisely. The cursor keys on your keyboard offer another alternative way to quickly change directions.
Zoom in and out by moving the vertical slider up and down. If your mouse has got a mouse wheel you can use that one instead - or you just hold the LMB; and the RMB; down both at once while moving the mouse up and down. Changing the zoom level step by step can be done via the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons which are placed above and below the zoom slider (or using the + and - keys on your keyboard).
marble; tile levels
Different Tile Levels in marble;
When downloading a map region for offline usage you need to download all tiles in the desired region for all tile levels you plan to use. Because of the connection between tile levels and zoom levels you can think of it as downloading all tiles in the zoom levels you plan to use.
To accomplish this for a certain region make that region visible in the screen by zooming and moving the Globe. Now open the Download Region dialog in the File menu. Keep the Visible region option selected to download those tiles that correspond to the map region visible in the screen. Next select the tile level range (zoom range) you wish to download. The first field corresponds to the smallest the second field corresponds to the largest tile level that will be downloaded. Tile levels in between will be downloaded as well. marble; shows how many tiles (images) need to be downloaded and updates this number whenever you change the region or tile level range.

There are two caches being used for marble; The physical memory which is needed to keep map data in the computer's memory. Increasing the value will make the application more responsive. The hard disc memory cache is used by download contents from the Internet (eg; Wikipedia data or map data).

Once the practice mode Gender of Nouns is activated click on Start Practice.
In the case below we use German as language to learn and so you have three genders to choose from masculine feminine and neuter. By clicking on Hint one of the wrong answers gets excluded. Of course you can also decide to Answer Later by clicking on that button.
You should enter the articles for the language in the Editor to see the articles instead of the grammatical gender terms. Also note that this only works if the gender of the words has been set up properly. See Word Types for more information how to change the word type to the right gender.
When you give the correct answer the following is shown and you go ahead practicing by clicking on Continue.
Should you give the wrong answer the following is shown and you go ahead practicing by clicking on Continue.
Click on the button Create a New Collection.
The General Document Properties page shows up which is being filled as follows (just adapt to what your file is about)
Next click on OK. The following screen asks you to set up the language details. Here we don't want to change anything and therefore we just click on OK.
As a first step let's create the vocabulary part. We will think about the addition of the sound files and pictures in a second stage. This is what the unit looks like
Before we do anything else let's save the file to the folder with the pictures and sound-files. Use FileSave and select the folder using the navigation. In this example we will call the file Trainer eng-deu - once you entered the name just click on save.
For creating the graph we use a default graph generator provided by rocs;. This can be found in the main menu at Graph Document Tools Generate Graph. There we select a Random Graph with 30 nodes 90 edges and with seed 1 (the seed is the starting seed for the random graph generator; using the same seed multiple times results in same and reproducible graphs).
Creating the Element Types
We use the Element Types and create a second node type as well as a second edge type. For both new types we open the properties dialog by using the respective Properties buttons and set the IDs to 2. Furthermore we change the colors of elements of these two new types (to distinguish them from the default types). Finally we set all edge types to be bidirectional and the IDs of the default types to 1.
The Algorithm
At last we have to implement the approximation algorithm. For this we use the following implementation
Velocity of the each charged particle is set in some direction so the charged particles moves in respective direction of their velocity but each particle has been given a equal and opposite charge so the particles try to attract each other. As a result the simulation of the charged particles under these conditions can be seen on the scene.

Dithering generally provides better quality results however you may wish to disable it for artistic effects; eg; using Monochrome instead of Monochrome (Dithered) gives a silhouette effect.
Another important distinction is that while Monochrome (Dithered) will always reduce the entire image or selection to black and white Monochrome will do this only if the image or selection contains more than 2 colors.
For a quick dithered monochrome image or selection use the Reduce to Monochrome (Dithered) item of the Image or Selection menu. The Selection item is only displayed in the menubar if you use one of the selection tools. Additionally you can reach this action from the context menu opened with a RMB; click in the image area.
Changing the number of colors here has no effect on the color depth of the file format. If you want to change the color depth you should select it in the file saving dialogs. Note that confusingly changing the color depth also changes the number of colors.

This will make juk; try to guess information such as the Artist and Title of a song. juk; employs different methods of guessing
juk; will try to guess the tags of the song based on its filename. For example a song name such as Roxette - You've Got the Look.mp3 would guess Roxette for the artist and You've Got the Look as the title. You can adjust the way juk; guesses for tags by selecting Settings Tag Guesser which will open the Tag Guesser dialog. juk; will not replace tags that it did not guess from the file name.
juk; will try to guess the tags of the song by using the MusicBrainz program. You must have MusicBrainz installed for this command to work.
This will rename the selected files to conform to a given format. You must choose the way you want the files renamed first by selecting  SettingsFile Renamer. The resulting name of each file is based on its metadata tags. For example the Ogg Vorbis song The Theme (Metroid) by Stemage could result in /usr/share/music/Stemage/The Theme (Metroid).ogg.
This allows you to quickly create a playlist from songs in your Collection List. This function will prompt you for a name for the new playlist and will then insert all of the songs that are selected into the new playlist.
The Search bar
The search bar allows you to quickly search for a song in the collection list or a playlist.
Simply typing text into the search bar will reduce the visible list of songs to those which contain that text in any visible column. Pressing Enter; will start playing the top match in the playlist view.
Searching begins instantly when text is entered into the search field. Searching is incremental that is as you type each character into the text field the search is narrowed further. This is useful to find a song where you only remember part of a name for instance.

The result of the digital sampling process is a sequence of single samples. One sample is a digital representation of a signal's value at a certain time.
The value of a sample can be interpreted and encoded in several ways. The simplest one is linear encoding. This means that each sample's value directly represents the analogue signal's value multiplied with a constant factor. This is easy to handle but has the disadvantage that noise will be audible especially on low amplitudes where it disturbs most and less audible on high amplitudes where it is less audible.
One way to reduce the influence of noise is non-linear encoding. This means that lower amplitudes are amplified before processing. As lower amplitudes are amplified their distance from noise increases and the quality improves. The most common methods for this are A-Law and U-Law encoding - some standardized logarithmic amplification curves used in digital telephony (ITU G.711 standard).

Here's a screenshot of kwave;'s playback setup dialog
Screenshot of the Playback Setup Dialog
Currently kwave; supports only 8 and 16 bit playback with mono or stereo output through the OSS interface but many also all modes your sound hardware supports through the ALSA interface.
If your sound file uses more or less channels than the playback allows all channels will be mixed together during playback. For example if you have a file with three channels and you use stereo playback the left channel will play channel 0 (upper) and half of channel 1 (middle) the right channel will play the half of channel 1 (middle) and channel 2 (lower).
For getting a smooth playback without interruptions you should also set the buffer size to an appropriate value. If you encounter problems with interrupted playback you should increase the buffer size here. But the bigger you set the buffer the bigger is the latency between the audible sound and the display of the playback position in the signal display.
The URI; starts with the word kwave followed by a  and the command name.
If the command has parameters they have to be appended after the command name using a ? as separator.
Multiple parameters can be appended by using a  as separator.
All special characters in command name and parameters have to be URL; encoded. Here a list of the translations

kopete; is designed to integrate well with your kde; desktop; to make it immediately familiar. The user interface is clean and simple without any frills to distract the user. At the same time kopete; aims to make communication the focus of im; by removing the differences between different im; systems. One feature kopete; introduced to support this is the Metacontact combining the various means there are to contact someone into a single person in your contact list. Other multiprotocol instant messengers list the same person's various im; accounts separately making it confusing for non experienced people. kopete; makes life easy a metacontact is a person and contacts are ways to communicate with that person. You will recognize contacts in a metacontact easily as small icons representing the im; services you could use to communicate with that person.
kopete; is intended for all levels of users. Out of the box it supports a minimal set of functions to make chatting as easy as possible. More advanced users can add extra functions such as Statistics with kopete;'s plugin system.
More kopete; Information on the Web
If you need to contact the team the kopete; developers' mailing list is hosted at https//mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kopete-devel.
If you want live support there is an Internet Relay Chat channel for kopete; where you can find the team discussing technical (well not always) issues or just hanging out. You can use any IRC client to join the channel (including kopete;) just add an IRC contact and use irc.freenode.org as the server and #kopete as the channel name. See you there!
Input Area
The Input Area is below the Chat View. This is where you type messages before sending them. You can change the font and color of the message using the usual tools on the toolbar. If the im; system supports this your messages will appear in color when your contacts read them.
By default the keyboard shortcut to send messages is Enter;.
The Status Bar contains temporary messages such as notification that someone else is typing as well as the Send button.
kopete; lets you carry on multiple conversations in one window by putting each one in its own tab within the window. The tab titles change color to show when a new message has been received
ICQ has an Invisibility feature which allows you to hide from selected contacts. You may also search the ICQ user folder when adding a contact. A wide range of contact details can be set using the Properties option.
Jabber also known as XMPP supports file transfer conferencing and any other services supplied by the Jabber server. For example many Jabber servers have a user directory and some provide transports to other messaging systems. To access services use Services on the account menu. Jabber file transfer can work without port forwarding but enjoys better performance where a direct connection is possible. By default port 8010 is used for port forwarding but this is configurable in each account's settings.
Since Google Talk is based upon Jabber it is well supported in kopete; with the exception of voice chat which is worked upon.
To configure kopete; for Google Talk Use your complete Google Mail address as the user name. Check Use protocol encryption (SSL) Allow plain-text password authentication and Override default server information. The server is talk.google.com or gmail.com and ports 443 or 5223 should be used.
Novell GroupWise
As the error message indicates you are missing the QCA TLS plugin which handles the Jabber plugin's TLS/SSL encryption. Install the package qca-tls (and eventually qca-ossl) or retrieve the plugin from its homepage. Please note that you only need to install the qca-tls plugin not the QCA library itself. A recompilation of kopete; is not necessary in fact not even a restart. In case you have installed the plugin and it still won't work Qt can probably not find it. Since qca-tls installs itself as a Qt; plugin you will have to make sure that it gets installed to the plugin directory of the Qt; version you are using to run kopete;.
I use Jabber and ICQ together. Whenever I go online with Jabber I am disconnected from ICQ with an error message about being connected from another client. What's up?
Remember when you played with ICQ transports on that other Jabber client? You set up an ICQ Transport which allows you to talk to ICQ people from Jabber. ICQ doesn't allow multiple connections to the same account and disconnects you. Look in your Jabber contacts for a contact of the form 123456@icq.jabber.org and delete it.

When he registered an account on a server he chose a so-called JID (Jabber-Identifier). This JID works basically like an E-Mail-Address and is connected to the server's name with an @. An example for Romeo's valid JID is romeo@montague.net.
In order to talk to other people Romeo has to add their JIDs to his contact list. They may be connected to the same server (eg; bob@montague.net) as well as they can originate from another server (eg; peter@wasinet.org or of course juliet@capulet.com).
Visualization of the Jabber network
Jabber/XMPP is of course capable of a lot more services (eg; end-to-end encryption of the messages voice- and videochat groupchat) which the tutorial will partly introduce later.
Two very big instant messaging providers use Jabber/XMPP on their servers in the background Google Talk and facebook chat. Accounts within these systems can be used just like normal Jabber accounts in kopete;. Details will be explained later or can be found at these provider's websites.

The high level implementation of a system using the Remote Frame Buffer protocol is known as Virtual Network Computer or more often just as VNC.
Remote Frame Buffer (or RFB for short) is a simple protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces. It works at the frame-buffer level which roughly corresponds to the rendered screen image which means that it can be applied to all windowing systems (including X11 MacOS; and Microsoft; Windows;). Remote Frame Buffer applications exist for many platforms and can often be free re-distributed.
In the Remote Frame Buffer protocol the application that runs on the machine where the user sits (containing the display keyboard and pointer) is called the client. The application that runs on the machine where the framebuffer is located (which is running the windowing system and applications that the user is remotely controlling) is called the server. krdc; is the kde; client for the Remote Frame Buffer protocol. krfb; is the kde; server for the Remote Frame Buffer protocol.
It takes a reasonable amount of network traffic to send an image of the framebuffer so Remote Frame Buffer works best over high bandwidth links such as a local area network. It is still possible to use krdc; over other links but performance is unlikely to be as good.
Using krdc;
When someone connects to krfb; on your machine you will get a pop-up notification that looks like the following screenshot unless you are accepting unattended access without confirmation.
krfb; Connection Window
If you Accept Connection the client can proceed to authenticate which requires the correct password for a login. If you Refuse Connection then the attempt to connect will be terminated.
The Allow remote user to control keyboard and mouse check box determines whether this client can only observe or can take control of your machine.

According to the settings in your .cvsignore files the files you usually do not want to include into the repository - such as object files - are not shown in the tree view. For each file you see its corresponding status. In the default setting after opening the sandbox this is "Unknown" because cervisia; delays the fetching of information until you select the files and folders whose status you want to update or view and choose  File Update  or  File Status . With this approach you have a minimal amount of functionality available even if you do not have a permanent connection to the CVS; server.
A screenshot of cervisia;'s main view
The commands in the File menu usually act only on the files which you have marked. You may also mark folders. Now choose  File Status  or press F5. cervisia; issues a
cvs update -n file names
command to get status information for the marked files. Note that cervisia; goes recursively into subfolders only if you have the according option in the Settings menu set. According to the respective file's status you now see an entry in the Status column
View the revision author date branch commit message and tags for each version of the marked file.
View a graphical tree representation showing the branching and tagging of the marked file.
View any version of the marked file (with the default application).
Watch an annotated view of any version of the marked file
View the differences between any pair of versions of the marked file including pairs with the current working copy version of the marked file.
The reverse effect is achieved by using AdvancedUnlock Files. This runs the command
cvs admin -u file names
Customizing cervisia;
cervisia; can be customized in various ways to your needs and preferences. Some options which you may want to change regularly are directly available in the Settings menu.
Whenever you use the menu item FileInsert ChangeLog Entry a new ChangeLog entry is generated with the current date and your username. Normally it is considered good style to insert your full name and your email address into each of your ChangeLog entries. cervisia; automatically adds the full name and email address entered here.

pruneemptydirs is used to clean up a local CVS tree. It detects directories containing remnants of old stuff which has been removed from the CVS. Such stale directories often break compilation. The current directory and all directories beneath it will be examined.
Exporting to an Image
You can also export a complete diagram as an image. The only thing you need to do is select the diagram you want to export and then the option Export as Picture from the Diagram menu.
umbrello; allows you to print individual diagrams. Press the Print button on the application toolbar or selecting the Print option from the File menu will give you a standard kde; Print dialog from where you can print your diagrams.
Logical Folders
To better organize your model especially for larger projects you can create logical folders in the Tree View. Just select the option NewFolder from the context menu of the default folders in the Tree View to create them. Folders can be nested and you can move objects around by dragging them from one folder and dropping them into another.
Note that not every change in one of the attributes of an object should be represented by a State but only those changes that can significantly affect the workings of the object
There are two special types of States Start and End. They are special in that there is no event that can cause an Object to return to its Start state in the same way as there is no event that can possible take an Object out of its End state once it has reached it.
Activity Diagrams describe the sequence of activities in a system with the help of Activities. Activity Diagrams are a special form of State Diagrams that only (or mostly) contains Activities.
An example Activity Diagram.
umbrello; showing an Activity Diagram
To insert elements that already exist in your model just drag them from the Tree View and drop them where you want them to be in your diagram. You can always move elements around in your Diagram using the Select Tool
The second way of adding elements to your diagram is by using the Work Toolbar's edit tools (note that this will also add the elements to your model).
The Work Toolbar was by default located on the top of the window. The tools available on this toolbar (the buttons you see on it) change depending on the type of diagram you are currently working on. The button for the currently selected tool is activated in the toolbar. You can switch to the select tool by pressing the Esc; key.
When you have selected an edit tool from the Work Toolbar (for example the tool to insert classes) the mouse pointer changes to a cross and you can insert the elements in your model by single clicking in your diagram. Note that elements in UML; must have a Unique Name. So that if you have a class in one diagram whose name is ClassA and then you use the insert Class tool to insert a class into another diagram you cannot name this new class ClassA as well. If these two are supposed to be two different elements you have to give them a unique name. If you are trying to add the same element to your diagram then the Insert Class is not the right tool for that. You should drag and drop the class from the Tree View instead.
Deleting Elements
Alternatively you can use ark; to extract a full backup or just a few files from a backup.
Using kbackup;
All you need to do is to select which folders you want to store. This is done by selecting all the folders in the tree view on the left side of the main window.
If you select a folder kbackup; will automatically store all files and subfolders below it. If you want to exclude parts of a selected folder simply deselect that files/folders inside the still selected folder.
In general this means A selected folder will store everything in it and below it except the deselected parts in it. This also means whenever you reuse a profile (see below) later on and new files have been added to a folder already selected for backup all the new files will also be stored.

Left clicking on the header of a particular column sorts the devices according to that variable. A second left click sorts in the opposite order.
Right clicking on a row pops up a menu. If that device is not currently mounted the Mount Device option is available. If the device is mounted it can be unmounted by choosing Unmount Device. Selecting Open in File Manager opens a new window with a graphical view of the files on that device.
The appropriate mount and unmount commands and how the file manager is opened from the context menu can be configured from the kdiskfree; application.

Signatures allow navigating through your keyring. Double clicking on a signature or a key shown as member of a group will jump directly to the corresponding primary key.
The key properties window
While the key manager allows you to do general actions with one or multiple keys key groups or signatures the key properties window gives you access to a single key. You can reach it by pressing enter in the key manager or double clicking the key.
In this window you can change the key passphrase and expiration of your secret keys. For all keys you can also set the owner trust value.
This value indicates how much you trust the owner of this key to correctly verify the identity of the keys he signs. Taking the owner trust into account gpg creates your own web of trust. You trust the keys you signed. If you assign owner trust to these persons you will also trust the keys they have signed without the need that you first have to sign their keys too.

You can put the message in your queued messages by selecting the Send Later button to schedule the message immediately.
This agent works independent from kmail; and does not need a running kmail; instance or kmail; being in online mode to send scheduled emails.
If you have no network connection when a scheduled message should be sent the agent will report an error and ask if you want to resend it later.
At login to a kde; session the agent checks the scheduled messages and sends all messages overdue since the last logout if necessary.
To change the options for emails you have scheduled to send later use Settings Configure kmail; then select the Plugins page in kmail; and press the configuration button against the Send Later Agent item.

If you use multiple alarm calendars you can color code alarms according to which calendar they belong to by selecting a different background color for each calendar (see Using Calendars).
By default kalarm; archives alarms for a limited period once they have expired or been deleted. (But note that alarms which you delete are stored only if they have already triggered at least once.) You can control whether kalarm; archives expired alarms and for how long in the Configuration dialog.
Archived alarms may be shown in the alarm list by selecting ViewShow Archived Alarms. To hide them again deselect ViewShow Archived Alarms.
Searching the Alarm List
You can search through the alarm list to find alarms containing a search text. To invoke this select  EditFind. In the search dialog select the alarm types which you wish to search. To continue searching for more alarms which match use  EditFind Next or  EditFind Previous .
Remove the selected calendar from the list. The calendar itself is left intact; it is simply removed from the list and may subsequently be reinstated in the list if desired.
Edit the selected calendar. This displays the configuration dialog for the selected calendar.
Reload the selected calendar. The calendar is re-read from its storage location ensuring that there is no discrepancy between what kalarm; displays and the current state of the calendar. If the calendar is shared with other users any changes which they have made will now be seen by kalarm;.
If you reload a remote calendar any changes to alarms which you have made since the calendar was last saved will be lost. Also any alarms which have expired since the last save may be retriggered.
Import alarms from an external calendar file into the selected calendar. This is described in Importing Alarms from External Calendars. This option is not available for disabled or read-only calendars.
If desired choose a time zone to apply to the alarm. This time zone is used for all dates and times relating to this alarm including recurrence and exception dates and times. Normally you should leave the time zone controls unchanged unless you have a good reason to change them.
The time zone controls are displayed only when the selected time zone is different from the default time zone set in the Configuration dialog or if you click the Time Zone button.
In the combo box choose the time zone which this alarm is to use. When creating a new alarm this is initially set to the time zone selected in the Configuration dialog which will be your computer's time zone unless you have changed it.
Select System time zone if you want to use the local computer time zone (on whichever computer kalarm; happens to be running on at the time).
For a display alarm check Reminder if you want to display a reminder either before or after the main alarm and each of its recurrences (if any). Enter how long in advance or afterwards using the edit controls beside the check box. Note that if the alarm recurs the reminder period is normally limited to being less than the recurrence or sub-repetition interval.
You can reload an individual calendar and refresh its alarms in the alarm list by Right clicking the calendar in the calendars list and selecting the Reload menu option. See Alarm Calendars for details.
Enabling and Disabling Alarms
Alarms may be enabled and disabled either as a whole or individually
Alarm monitoring applies to alarms as a whole. While alarm monitoring is disabled no alarms are triggered at all. While alarm monitoring is enabled (the normal situation) all alarms which are not individually disabled will trigger at the appropriate times.
When alarm monitoring is re-enabled alarms which would have triggered while it was disabled are now triggered (unless any late-cancel option prevents this). In other words disabling alarm monitoring has the same effect as stopping kalarm; ndash; alarms are postponed until it is re-enabled.
The Alarm List group box allows the selection of the colors used in the alarm list in kalarm;'s main window to show disabled and archived alarms.
The Alarm Windows tab contains options to control the appearance of alarm message windows.
Position windows far from mouse cursor Select this option to display alarm message windows as far away from the current mouse cursor position as possible. This minimizes the chance of accidentally acknowledging an alarm by unintentionally clicking on a button just as the message window appears.
Center windows delay activating window buttons Select this option to display alarm message windows in the center of the screen. To reduce the chance of accidentally acknowledging the alarm the window's buttons are initially disabled. The delay in seconds before they become active is set in Button activation delay (seconds).
Message windows have a titlebar and take keyboard focus This option controls whether alarm message windows are modal or not ie; whether they grab the keyboard focus when they appear. See the Alarm Message Window section for details.
--edit-new-email
Display the Alarm Edit dialog in order to edit a new email alarm.
--edit-new-preset templateName

--list
bool editNew(int type)
bool editNew(const QStringamp; templateName)
Specifies the alarm type. The permissible values are DISPLAY COMMAND EMAIL AUDIO. These are defined in class KAlarmIface in kalarmiface.h.
templateName
Specifies the name of an alarm template to base the new alarm on.
The next step in the wizard is to select whether to store the certificate in a file or send it directly to a ca;. You will have to specify the filename or email address to send the certificate request to.
This revocation signature is stored in a separate file. This file can later be imported into the keyring and is then attached to the key rendering it unusable. Please note that to import this signature to the key no password is required. Therefore you should store this revocation signature in a safe place usually one that is different from you key pair. It is a good advise to use a place that is detached from your computer either copy it to an external storage device like an USB stick or print it out.
kleopatra; does not provide a function to create such a revocation signature at any time but you can do that with the kde; application kgpg; by choosing Keys Revoke key and optionally importing the revocation signature to your keyring immediately.
An alternative way of generating a revocation certificate is to use gpg; directly from the command line gpg --output revocationcertificate.asc --gen-revoke yourkey. The argument yourkey must be a key specifier either the key ID of your primary keypair or any part of a user ID that identifies your keypair.
Ctrl;N FileNew Certificate
Use this function to remove unused keys from your local keybox. However since certificates are typically attached to signed emails verifying an email might result in the key just removed to pop back into the local keybox. So it is probably best to avoid using this function as much as possible. When you are lost use the search bar or the  function to regain control over the lot of certificates.
There is one exception to the above When you delete one of your own certificates you delete the secret key along with it. This implies that you will not be able to read past communication encrypted to you using this certificate unless you have a backup somewhere.
kleopatra; will warn you when you attempt to delete a secret key.
Due to the hierarchical nature of smime; certificates if you delete an smime; issuer certificate (ca; certificate) all subjects are deleted too.
This is the same as a filesystem When you delete a folder you delete all files and folders in it too.
To use the modified standard font select the category in the list and check or uncheck the font modifiers Italic Bold and/or Strikeout. You can immediately see the effect on the font in the category list.

Since backslash (\) is an escape character in kde; config files you need to double them when they appear in path names pack-command=C\\Programs\\GNU\\tar\\gtar.exenbsp; However for the command itself (as opposed to its arguments) you may just use forward slashes (/) as path separators on all platforms pack-command=C/Programs/GNU/tar/gtar.exenbsp; This is not supported in arguments as most Windows; programs use the forward slash for options. For example the following will not work since C/myarchivescript.bat is an argument to cmd.exe and / is not converted to \ in arguments only commands pack-command=cmd.exe C/myarchivescript.bat This needs instead to be written as
pack-command=cmd.exe C\\myarchivescript.bat
Input Filename Passing for pack-command
You can exercise more fine-grained control over where to file sent messages by creating a corresponding message filter that is applied to outgoing messages.
Select the folder into which drafts should be filed when using this identity. imap; users should consider changing this to an imap; folder so their drafts are stored on a server instead of being stored in a local folder. This way they can easily continue to work on their drafts at a different location.
Select the folder into which templates should be filed when using this identity. Please see Compose from templates for more information on templates.
Select or enter an alternative SMTP; server to be used when sending messages using this identity.
You need to configure outgoing mail servers first before you can choose them from the list. You can do this on the Sending tab of the  Accounts page.
Autocorrect Options
This allows you to configure kmail; to autocorrect various simple corrections. Check the box next to the autocorrect feature you would like to enable.
You can replace double or single quotes with typographical quotes by checking the appropriate box. You can also add non breaking space before specific punctuation marks in French text by selecting the option.
You can enter custom automatic word replacement by checking this option. To enter a custom string to replace automatically enter the word to be replaced in the Find box and the replacement word in the Replace box and click the Add button. To remove a custom word replacement string highlight the string and click Remove.
This allows you to set exceptions where you would like kmail; to ignore your autocorrect selections for end of sentence and two uppercase letters. Enter the exception and click Add button. To remove the exception highlight the string and click Remove button.
Enable this option if important messages should never be deleted during message expiration ie; during automatic deletion of old messages.
This option controls what happens if you press one of the shortcuts to go to the next or previous unread message (eg; Space). If you ask kmail; to go to the next unread message although there is no unread message below the currently selected message then the following happens   If Do not Loop is selected then nothing will happen.    If Loop in Current Folder is selected then kmail; will search from the beginning of the current folder for an unread message. If none is found then nothing happens.   If Loop in All Folders is selected then kmail; will first search in the current folder for another unread message. If none is found then kmail; will search the next folder containing unread messages.    Correspondingly if you ask kmail; to go to the previous unread message.
This option controls what happens if you open a folder.
If Jump to First Unread Message is selected then kmail; will select the first message it finds that is marked as unread.
If Jump to Last Selected Message is selected then kmail; will select the message that was selected when the folder was open the last time.

Why does kmail; not start up?
Symptom You want to start kmail; from a minimal desktop environment like fvwm2. It does not start.
Reason You are missing the dbus functionality.
Solution Start kmail; using dbus-launch like this
dbus-launch kmail

File Empty All Trash Folders
Use this to empty all trash folders ie; the local trash folder and all trash folders that you might have on imap; servers.
Sets kmail; to offline mode. This turns off all network jobs. This is useful when working with messages without a network connection. This selection will become FileWork Online which needs to be selected to go back online (required to send and receive).
 Ctrl;L  File Check Mail
Checks for new messages in all your accounts.
Folder Delete Folder
Removes the selected folder and all its contents including subfolders.
Please note that there is no way to access the contents of a folder after it has been removed.
 Ctrl;*  Folder Remove Duplicate Messages
Searches the folder for duplicate messages and deletes them.
Tools Debug Sieve
Launch the Sieve Diagnostics dialog. This is useful to debug sieve if you are having problems with it.
You must have sieve support on your email server.
Tools Filter Log Viewer
Opens up the viewer window for the filter log; there you find some options to control the logging of the filtering process. In the log you will find valuable information about what filter rules were used what was the result of the evaluation of those rules and which filter actions were applied to a message.
Options Rich Text Editing
Enables Rich Text/html; editing.
Options Encoding
Set the charset encoding of this message. The chosen encoding will appear in the header of the outgoing mail. You can use Auto for almost all cases kmail; will tell you if you need to select a different encoding manually.
Options Wordwrap
If it keeps reappearing and the Mail Dispatcher Agent still crashes you need to do one more thing in akonadiconsole. Go to the Browser tab find the outbox you want to use right click on it select Folder Properties Attributes tab enter SpecialCollectionAttribute then click Add double click on the Value near the SpecialCollectionAttribute and enter outbox. Add also another attribute the attribute name has to be ENTITYDISPLAY and the value ("outbox" "mail-folder-outbox" "" ()) (just copy paste from here). Restart akonadi and now you should be able to remove completely the unneeded local folder account.
You get the error Unable to fetch item from backend when entering IMAP folder
There are a number of possible reasons for this and it is something the kmail; team hopes to tackle in time. Meanwhile there are some workarounds
Workaround 1
edit /.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf
Signing and Encrypting Messages
If you want to send an encrypted or digitally signed message select the Sign Message or Encrypt Message icons in the toolbar. Moreover you can select the format that should be used to sign and/or encrypt the message. Depending on the installed encryption programs you can choose between
kmail; will use a format which is understood by all recipients of the message. The preferred format of the recipients can be specified in the kde; Address Book.
This format is outdated. If you use this format then only the message text will be signed and/or encrypted. Attachments will neither be signed nor encrypted. HTML; messages cannot be signed with this format. You should only use this format if necessary ie; if you send messages to users of email clients that cannot handle the more advanced formats.
This format is the successor of the inline OpenPGP format. If you use this format then the message text and all attachments will be signed and/or encrypted (at least by default). This is the recommended format if you use OpenPGP.
Grants the users identified by User Id reading posting writing (see above) as well as administration rights ie; the right to modify the acl; of this folder.
This is the default set of rights for the owner of a folder.
summarizes the imap; acl; rights associated with each permission level.
acl; Rights Summary
acl; right
This will redirect the message as-is to another email address.
Will try to return a message to the sender that indicates successful delivery of their message if the sender requested that.
This action allows you to select who will get delivery receipts from you. Though you can globally enable the sending of delivery confirmations in the Configure kmail; dialog (Security page) we recommended not to send them to everyone since this makes tracking of spam messages for example very easy for the sender.
This currently only works if the message has at least one attachment. No not even percnt;0 will work in the general case!
You can enter arbitrarily-complex shell commands here since kmail; uses a sub shell to execute the command line; therefore even this command will work (within its limits) uudecode -o $(mktemp kmail-uudecoded.XXXXXX) amp;amp; echo $'\a'
If this option is off and you want to send an encrypted message to somebody then you cannot read this message any longer after you have composed and encrypted it. Turn this option on to keep sent encrypted messages readable for you too.
When this box is checked sent messages are stored encrypted like they were sent. This is not recommended as you will not be able to read the messages any longer if a necessary certificate expires.
This will always open a dialog that lets you choose the keys used for each recipient when you are sending an encrypted message; if this option is off kmail; will show this dialog only when it cannot find a key for a recipient or when there are conflicting or unset encryption preferences.
If this option is on kmail; will automatically encrypt messages with the built-in OpenPGP support or the PGP/MIME;-Plugin provided that for every recipient a trusted PGP key is found in your keyring and you did not tell kmail; not to encrypt messages sent to certain recipients. If in doubt kmail; will ask whether the message should be encrypted or not.
Now that you have setup the encryption tool you have to tell kmail; which OpenPGP key you want to use for signing and for encrypting messages; to do this go to the Identities configuration and set the key that should be used on the Cryptography tab of the identity configuration.
To delete a note RMB; click on the note titlebar and select Delete.
Hiding a note
To hide a note click the X in the upper right corner of the titlebar of the note or select  Esc;Hide  in the context menu. The note will no longer be displayed on the screen. The note itself will not be deleted.
Setting an alarm
Select Set Alarm in the context menu of the note titlebar. Check Alarm at in the next dialog and adjust the date and time for the reminder. At alarm time a popup window will be displayed and list all notes with the actual alarm date.
Changing behaves in the same way as inserting you can change an event's start date and time end date and time summary location and description. Events successfully changed will be immediately shown modified within kde; calendar applications (korganizer;).
Example Here we change the summary and description of a calendar entry with UID konsolekalendar;-1887551750.196
Creating a New Calendar File
konsolekalendar; can be used to create new calendars from existing files. You can create the calendar using the option --create with the filename as argument. The file must be a valid iCal or vCal file.

The Month view shows all the events and due to-dos for the current month in a familiar month calendar layout. Each cell in the view represents a day and each day contains all of the events that can fit in the area provided (maximizing the window will enable you to see more appointments). Information on repeating and reminder status is indicated through bell and chasing arrows icons just as in other views.
Navigate the Month view using the Date Navigator arrows or the items and toolbar buttons from the Go menu. Since the visible area of a day cell may not contain all events and to-dos you can use the keyboard to browse the items or you can use the scrollbars to see all the events and to-dos from that day.
Assign a priority to your to-do. This drop down menu offers priorities from one to nine one being the highest. Initially to-dos are set to priority five (medium).
This is an overview of what fields are required and what fields can be empty when entering events and to-dos
In the General Tab you should at least fill the Title field and the description (the large rectangle) even though neither is mandatory. If you set a Reminder you should also specify the time and either the sound to be played or the program to be run.
The Attendees tab may be left completely empty.
The Recurrence tab must only be filled if you select a daily weekly monthly or yearly repeat.
Agenda View tab
Agenda View options
By using this you can control the height of the rows in the Agenda view.
Check this box to display icons (reminder recursion etc;) in Agenda view items
This check box toggles the display of to-dos in the Day Week and Month views in the Agenda view. If you have too many to-dos which have a due date associated you may want to turn them off to avoid clutter.
This action will remove all the completed to-dos from your active calendar.
When you choose Quit or click the Quit icon the current calendar window will quit prompting you to save if the current calendar has been modified but not yet saved.
This has no effect on other calendar windows which may be opened. You have to quit each calendar window individually.
With the Edit menu you can edit and search events and to-dos.
Cut Copy and Paste menu items behave in the same fashion as in other kde; applications. With the Find menu item you can find events and to-dos across the current calendar.
Choose this menu item to open the Edit Filters dialog. Using this dialog you can create delete and edit filters that will affect which items will be displayed by korganizer;.
Settings Manage Categories
Choose this menu item to open the Edit Categories dialog. Using this dialog you can create delete and edit calendar item categories. Categories are used to organize your events and to-dos in related groups.
In this chapter you'll learn of other useful features of korganizer; what tricks you can do with a click of your mouse.
A nice program to access a kde; calendar from the command line is konsolekalendar.

As soon as the variable has been declared it is automatically set to the "Null" value. Note the following conventions
Numeric variables are automatically assigned the value "0" as soon as they are declared.
Date variables are assigned the value 0 internally; equivalent to converting the value to "0" with the Day Month Year or the Hour Minute Second function.
String variables are assigned an empty-string ("") when they are declared.
Arrays
The single step execution using the Single Step icon causes the program to branch into procedures and functions.
The procedure step execution using the Procedure Step icon causes the program to skip over procedures and functions as a single step.
Properties of a Breakpoint
The properties of a breakpoint are available through its context menu by right-clicking the breakpoint in the breakpoint column.

The Listener must then be added to the Broadcaster Object. This is done by calling the appropriate method for adding a Listener. These methods always follow the pattern "addFooListener" where "Foo" is the Listener Interface Type without the 'X'. In this example the addContainerListener method is called to register the XContainerListener
oLib = BasicLibraries.Library1 ' Library1 must exist!
oLib.addContainerListener( oListener ) ' Register the listener
The Listener is now registered. When an event occurs the corresponding Listener calls the appropriate method from the com.sun.star.container.XContainerListener Interface.
The prefix calls registered Listeners from Basic-subroutines. The Basic run-time system searches for Basic-subroutines or functions that have the name "PrefixListenerMethode" and calls them when found. Otherwise a run-time error occurs.
PV function in CALC

Enable/disable the breakpoint at the current line or all breakpoints in the current selection.
Shift+F9
A running macro can be aborted with Shift+CommandCtrl+Q also from outside of the Basic IDE. If you are inside the Basic IDE and the macro halts at a breakpoint Shift+CommandCtrl+Q stops execution of the macro but you can recognize this only after the next F5 F8 or Shift+F8.
Manage Breakpoints dialog
Calls an "Open" dialog to import a BASIC dialog file.
If the imported dialog has a name that already exists in the library you see a message box where you can decide to rename the imported dialog. In this case the dialog will be renamed to the next free "automatic" name like when creating a new dialog. Or you can replace the existing dialog by the imported dialog. If you click Cancel the dialog is not imported.
Dialogs can contain localization data. When importing a dialog a mismatch of the dialogs' localization status can occur.
If the library contains additional languages compared to the imported dialog or if the imported dialog is not localized at all then the additional languages will silently be added to the imported dialog using the strings of the dialog's default locale.

At least one array must be part of the argument list. If only one array is given all array elements are summed.
=SUMPRODUCT(A1B3;C1D3) returns 397.
Calculation A1*C1 + B1*D1 + A2*C2 + B2*D2 + A3*C3 + B3*D3
You can use SUMPRODUCT to calculate the scalar product of two vectors.
INDIRECT(Ref; A1)
Ref represents a reference to a cell or an area (in text form) for which to return the contents.
If you open an Excel spreadsheet that uses indirect addresses calculated from string functions the sheet addresses will not be translated automatically. For example the Excel address in INDIRECT("[filename]sheetname!"B1) is not converted into the Calc address in INDIRECT("filename#sheetname."B1).
=INDIRECT(A1) equals 100 if A1 contains C108 as a reference and cell C108 contains a value of 100.
=SUM(INDIRECT("a1"  ADDRESS(1;3))) totals the cells in the area of A1 up to the cell with the address defined by row 1 and column 3. This means that area A1C1 is totaled.
ROWS(Array)
Array is the reference or named area whose total number of rows is to be determined.
=Rows(B5) returns 1 because a cell only contains one row.
=ROWS(A10B12) returns 3.

The goal of the solver process is to find those variable values of an equation that result in an optimized value in the target cell also named the "objective". You can choose whether the value in the target cell should be a maximum a minimum or approaching a given value.
The initial variable values are inserted in a rectangular cell range that you enter in the By changing cells box.
You can define a series of limiting conditions that set constraints for some cells. For example you can set the constraint that one of the variables or cells must not be bigger than another variable or not bigger than a given value. You can also define the constraint that one or more variables must be integers (values without decimals) or binary values (where only 0 and 1 are allowed).
The default solver engine supports only linear equations.
The Options dialog for the Solver is used to set some options.

In this area you can choose between two Y axis scaling modes. The axes can only be scaled and given properties separately.
This option is active as default. All data series are aligned to the primary Y axis.
Changes the scaling of the Y axis. This axis is only visible when at least one data series is assigned to it and the axis view is active.
Define the settings for a bar chart in this area. Any changes apply to all data series of the chart not to the selected data only.
Use this feature if you are working with values that differ sharply from each other. You can use logarithmic scaling to make the grid lines of the axis equidistant but have values that may increase or decrease.
Defines where the lower and where the higher values are displayed at the axis. The unchecked state is the mathematical direction. That means for Cartesian coordinate systems that the x-axis shows the lower values on the left and the y-axis shows the lower values at the bottom. For polar coordinate systems the mathematical angle axis direction is counterclockwise and the radial axis is from inner to outer.
For some types of axes you can select to format an axis as text or date or to detect the type automatically. For the axis type "Date" you can set the following options.

Missing Element
queries; missing elements (Base)
If a query in which tables or fields no longer exist is opened the Missing Element dialog appears. This dialog names the missing table or the field which cannot be interpreted and allows you to decide how to continue with the procedure.
How to continue?
For a query involving several fields the combination of values from all fields must be unique so that the result can be formed from a specific record. For example you have "Smith in Chicago" once in your address book and "Smith in London" twice. With the Distinct Values command the query will use the two fields "last name" and "city" and return the query result "Smith in Chicago" once and "Smith in London" once.
In SQL this command corresponds to the DISTINCT predicate.

Signatures and software versions
The signing of contents got changed with OpenOffice.org 3.2 and StarOffice 9.2. Now all contents of the files except the signature file itself (META-INF/documentsignatures.xml) are signed.
When you sign a document with OpenOffice.org 3.2 or StarOffice 9.2 or a later version and you open that document in an older version of the software the signature will be displayed as "invalid". Signatures created with older versions of the software will be marked with "only parts of the document are signed" when loaded in the newer software.
When you sign an OOXML document then the signature will be always marked with "only parts of the document are signed". Metadata of OOXML files are never signed to be compatible with Microsoft Office.
When you sign a PDF document then this marking is not used. Signing only parts of the document is simply an invalid signature.
Using data in a text document
You can insert a database field in a text document by dragging a field name from the column header of the data source view into the document. This is especially useful when designing form letters. Simply drag the desired fields - home address form of address and so on - into your document.
To insert a complete record select the corresponding header and drag it into the document. When you release the mouse button the Insert database columns dialog appears in which you can decide whether to use all database fields and whether to copy the data into the document as text a table or fields. All currently selected records will be inserted.
Applying data to a table document
You can insert one or more records into the current sheet of a spreadsheet by selecting the rows in the data source view and dragging and dropping them into the spreadsheet. The data is inserted at the place where you release the mouse button.

Pros and cons of compositing
Better look amp; feel Window animations shadows and transparency.
Better support for modern applications Client-side decorations in GTK3 are better supported by composited window managers.
GPU rendering Depending on your graphics card and your drivers rendering with the GPU (as opposed to the CPU) can result in visual artefacts or screen tearing.
Resource usage Compositing requires more resources. This can result in slower performance or reduced battery autonomy on laptop computers.
- In the Fcitx configuration screen add the Pinyin input method (uncheck "Only Show Current Language" if necessary).

System Log Viewer is useful if you are new to system administration because it provides an easier more user-friendly display of your logs than a text display of the log file. It is also useful for more experienced administrators as it contains a monitor to enable you to continuously monitor crucial logs.

-r --redirect-output file-name
Writes all messages to the file file-name instead of to the console.  While this can be done easily with output redirection there are cases in which this option is needed when the terminal reinterprets the output before writing it to a file.  The character set set with --output-charset is honored.
--flush-on-close
Tells the program to flush all data cached in memory to storage when closing files opened for writing.  This can be used to prevent data loss on power outages or to circumvent certain problems in the operating system or drivers.  The downside is that multiplexing will take longer as mkvmerge will wait until all data has been written to the storage before exiting.  See issues #2469 and #2480 on the MKVToolNix bug tracker for in-depth discussions on the pros and cons.

This program takes the input from several media files and joins their streams (all of them or just a selection) into a matroska; file; see the matroska; website.
The order of command line options is important. Please read the section quot;Option orderquot; if you're new to the program.

--split parts000120-000245+000550-001030
--split parts-000245000550-
Examples 
The parts mode tells mkvmerge; to keep certain ranges of timestamps while discarding others. The ranges to keep have to be listed after the parts keyword and be separated by commas. A range itself consists of a start and an end timestamp in the same format the other variations of --split accept (e.g. both 000120 and 80s refer to the same timestamp).
If a start timestamp is left out then it defaults to the previous range's end timestamp. If there was no previous range then it defaults to the start of the file (see example 3).

--projection-private TIDdata
Sets private data that only applies to a specific projection. Data must be given as hex numbers with or without the quot;0xquot; prefix with or without spaces.
--projection-pose-yaw TIDfloat
Regular track IDs
Some of the options for mkvmerge; need a track ID to specify which track they should be applied to.  Those track IDs are printed by the readers when demuxing the current input file or if mkvmerge; is called with the --identify option.  An example for such output
Do not confuse the track IDs that are assigned to the tracks that are placed in the output MKV file with the track IDs of the input files. Only the input file track IDs are used for options needing these values.
Also note that each input file has its own set of track IDs. Therefore the track IDs for file 'file1.ext' as reported by 'mkvmerge --identify' do not change no matter how many other input files are there or in which position 'file1.ext' is used.
Track IDs are assigned like this
[EBML head] [segment [segment information] [track information] [cluster 1]]
This might be the case for audio-only files.
External timestamp files
mkvmerge; allows the user to chose the timestamps for a specific track himself. This can be used in order to create files with variable frame rate video or include gaps in audio. A frame in this case is the unit that mkvmerge; creates separately per matroska; block. For video this is exactly one frame for audio this is one packet of the specific audio type. E.g. for AC-3 this would be a packet containing 1536 samples.
Timestamp files that are used when tracks are appended to each other must only be specified for the first part in a chain of tracks.  For example if you append two files v1.avi and v2.avi and want to use timestamps then your command line must look something like this
Removing all tags requires leaving out the file name

Replacing the chapters in a file looks like this

If you want to use the Suspend-to-Disk feature of antiX Linux you will need a swap partition that is larger than your physical memory size.If you choose a separate /home partition it will be easier for you to upgrade in the future but this will not be possible if you are upgrading from an installation that does not have a separate home partition.UpgradingTo upgrade from an existing Linux installation select the same home partition as before and check the preference to preserve data in /home.If you are preserving an existing /home directory tree located on your root partition the installer will not reformat the root partition. As a result the installation will take much longer than usual.Preferred Filesystem TypeFor antiX Linux you may choose to format the partitions as ext2 ext3 ext4 jfs xfs btrfs or reiser. Additional compression options are available for drives using btrfs. Lzo is fast but the compression is lower. Zlib is slower with higher compression.Bad BlocksIf you choose ext2 ext3 or ext4 as the format type you have the option of checking and correcting for badblocks on the drive. The badblock check is very time consuming so you may want to skip this step unless you suspect that your drive has badblocks.
Adjusting Your Sound MixerantiX Linux attempts to configure the sound mixer for you but sometimes it will be necessary for you to turn up volumes and unmute channels in the mixer in order to hear sound. The mixer shortcut is located in the menu. Click on it to open the mixer.

General InstructionsBEFORE PROCEEDING CLOSE ALL OTHER APPLICATIONS.On each page please read the instructions make your selections and then click on Next when you are ready to proceed. You will be prompted for confirmation before any destructive actions are performed.MX Linux requires about 3.5 GB of space. 5 GB or more is preferred. You can use the entire disk or you can put MX Linux on existing partitions. If you are running Mac OS or Windows OS (from Vista onwards) you may have to use that system's software to set up partitions and boot manager before installing MX Linux.The ext2 ext3 ext4 jfs xfs btrfs and reiserfs Linux filesystems are supported and ext4 is recommended.

Cable/IP settings you have to select if DNS servers are declared by the DHCP server or are manually specified as explained below. In the last case the IP address of DNS servers has to be set. The HOSTNAME of the computer can be specified here. If no HOSTNAME is specified the name localhost.localdomain is attributed by default.  The Hostname can also be provided by the DHCP server with the option Assign host name from DHCP server. Not all DHCP servers have such a function and if you're setting up your PC to get an IP address from a domestic ADSL router it is unlikely.
Cable/IP settings you need to declare what DNS servers to use. The HOSTNAME of the computer can be specified here. If no HOSTNAME is specified the name localhost.localdomain is attributed by default.
In advanced settings you can specified a Search domain. It would usually be your home domain i.e. if your computer is called "splash" and it's full domain name is "splash.boatanchor.net" the Search Domain would be "boatanchor.net". Unless you specifically need it it's ok not to define this setting. Again domestic connection would not need this setting.

Mixxx Setup
Opening Mixxx
|logo| Once you've ref`installed Mixxx ` start by opening Mixxx and import your music to the Mixxx library.
Double-click the Mixxx icon on the Desktop. Alternatively browse your Windows start menu and click the Mixxx icon or perform a search for file`Mixxx.exe`.
**Mac OSX**
There may be situations where BPM and beat detection do not result in a proper beat grid.
Typically the detected BPM is correct but the analyzer has failed to detect the location of the first beat. Consequently the beat markers are shifted i.e. the beat markers are always a fixed distance from the true beat. To adjust the beat grid cue the track before a real beat and click the guilabel`Beat-grid Adjust` button in the ref`interface-button-grid`.
If the detected BPM is not accurate the corresponding beat grid will also be inaccurate. A deviation of 0.02 BPM units from the correct BPM will cause beatgrid alignment issues on long tracks (e.g. a club mix). If this happens your beatgrid may look aligned for the few minutes but you will notice a slight drift as the song goes on. Finding the correct BPM is easy in many cases - just follow the note below.
If the detected BPM value is not sufficiently accurate but very close to an integer value try to set the BPM value manually to the integer.

Search for *mixxx* in the App Store alternatively `click this direct link ` .
Select Mixxx and click the guilabel`Install` button.
Type in your administrator password if asked.
Mixxx will be installed to your file`Applications` folder.
The App Store version of Mixxx is under some circumstances out of date therefore using `Method A Direct Download` is preferable.

**Special filtering**
Supports fuzzy matching of key searches. The following example list tracks with harmonically compatible keys to C# minor.
You can combine operators but there's no way to do an “OR” search right now. The following example list all tracks by “Danger” over 3 minutes long that are rated 4 or 5.
Negative search filters. Use the ``-`` prefix as negation operator. The following example would find “hip-hop“ from any year but 1990.
**Duplicate** Just like playlists you can duplicate an existing crate. Select the crate you would like to duplicate choose guilabel`Duplicate Crate` name the new crate and click guilabel`OK`.
**Remove** Removes an unlocked crate. Tracks in the crate are still available in the library for later use.
**Lock** |icliblocked| This icon indicates a locked crate. If a crate is locked you cannot add tracks rename or delete the crate. Choose guilabel`Unlock` from the context menu to unlock the crate.
**AutoDJ Track Source** Use this crate as a source for random tracks in AutoDJ.
**Analyze entire crate** Forces the analysis of the crate in the ref`Analyze ` view.
Often streaming hosts will run their own directories. Check your host's FAQ to find out. If you want to promote your streaming radio station even more register at services like `streamfinder.com `. An overview of different internet radio directories is available at `shoutcheap.com `
If you have trouble connecting to your streaming server check the configuration in the ref`live-broadcasting-preferences`.
You may need the term`LAME` libraries to stream in MP3. See ref`MP3 Streaming`.
You may have selected the term`Ogg Vorbis` format that is unsupported by Shoutcast servers.
You may need to check your firewall settings. Both Icecast and Shoutcast use two ports. If you are streaming on a port (for example port 8000) then you need to open up the next port (port 8001) as well.
You can connect as many controllers as you have ports on your computer. Just follow the steps in ref`control-midi` for each controller you want to use.
Laptop External Hardware Mixer and Vinyl Control
Using Mixxx together with turntables and external mixer
This setup allows DJs to use the techniques of DJing with vinyl record turntables combined with the portability and flexibility of a laptop computer. Instead of carrying crates of records or CDs DJs can carry their entire music collection on their laptop. In addition to a laptop and headphones this setup requires a soundcard with at least two pairs of stereo inputs and outputs as well as a pair of term`timecode` records.
Go to the chapter ref`vinyl-control` for detailed information.
Shoutcast is proprietary software that allows digital audio content to be broadcast to and from media player software enabling the creation of Internet radio stations.
soundcard
Also known as an audio card it is an internal computer expansion card or external expansion device that facilitates the input and output of audio signals to and from a computer. Today DJ-soundcards are usually connected via USB and have at least 2 stereo audio outputs to support term`cueing`.
Sync allows you to automatically adjust a track's term`tempo` and term`phase` to be in sync with another deck that is playing.
tempo
**SYNC button**
**Left-Click** Changes the term`rate` of the track so that the term`BPM` and term`phase` of the track matches the other deck.
**Right-Click** Only changes the term`rate` of the track to match the other deck but does not adjust the term`phase`.
Decks and samplers now pick which sync target to sync to on the fly. Decks can't sync to samplers and samplers can only sync to decks. The sync target for samplers is
The first deck (in numerical order) that is playing a track with a detected beatgrid and has a rate different than zero.
The crossfader section of the mixer with Play/Pause and Cue buttons
The term`crossfader` determines the actual volume of each deck when moving the slider from left to right. If both decks are playing and the crossfader is in its default center position then you will hear both decks. Right-clicking on the crossfader will reset the slider to its default position.
You can reverse the configuration of the crossfader so that the right deck is on the left end of the crossfader and vice versa. This is also known as *Hamster Style*. To adjust the crossfader to your style of mixing go to menuselection`Preferences --> Crossfader`.
Using the ref`AutoDJ ` feature in Mixxx you can automate the crossfade between the decks.
Play/Pause Button
Hold this button and talk to mix the microphone input into the Mixxx master output. Short click on the button for latching. This is handy for talking for an extended period for example when ref`streaming ` a radio show. When in Latch mode click again to mute the microphone input.
This control determines the microphone input's mix orientation. Either to the left side of crossfader to the right side or to the center (default). Clicking cycles through all the options.
**Microphone Volume Meter**
This displays the microphone volume input signal strength.
**Microphone Gain Knob**
**Signal Quality**
The graph is displayed in menuselection`Preferences --> Vinyl Control` see ref`vinyl-control-signal-quality`.

This method uses a CAS server (Central Authentication Service) to authenticate users in a Single Sign On environment (SSO). You can also use a simple LDAP authentication. If the given username and password are valid according to CAS Moodle creates a new user entry in its database taking user attributes from LDAP if required. On following logins only the username and password are checked.
Turn this on if you want to use CAS authentication.

Facebook Container
Facebook Container blocks these trackers. However if you click on any of these buttons Facebook will be able to track you.
Facebook Container creates a boundary between Facebook sites and the rest of the web so it’s harder for Facebook to track you online.
Facebook Container did not detect any Facebook trackers on this page. However the page may still contain other types of trackers.

Distraction-free notes and writing
The Notes app is a distraction free notes taking app. It provides categories for better organization and supports formatting using [Markdown](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. Notes are saved as files in your Nextcloud so you can view and edit them with every Nextcloud client. Furthermore a separate [RESTful API](https//github.com/nextcloud/notes/wiki/API-0.2) allows for an easy integration into third-party apps (currently there are notes apps for [Android](https//github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes) and [iOS](https//github.com/owncloud/notes-iOS-App) which allow convenient access to your Nextcloud notes). Further features include marking notes as favorites.

What is ScratchJr?
ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5-7) to create their own interactive stories and games. Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move jump dance and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor add their own voices and sounds even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.
ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http//scratch.mit.edu) used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children carefully designing features to match young children's cognitive personal social and emotional development.ScratchJr is available as a free app for both iPad and Android tablets. For more information about ScratchJr see http//scratchjr.org
Why Did We Create ScratchJr?
Coding (or computer programming) is a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas the same is true for coding. In the past coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone just like writing.As young children code with ScratchJr they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer not just to interact with it. In the process children learn to solve problems and design projects and they develop sequencing skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr children aren't just learning to code they are coding to learn.

After selecting the Cut tool you can tap a character or shape to remove it from the canvas.
After selecting the Duplicate tool you can tap a character or shape to create a copy of it.
As young children code with ScratchJr they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer not just to interact with it.

They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr children aren't just learning to code they are coding to learn.
ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies group at Tufts University the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab and the Playful Invention Company. Two Sigma led the implementation of the Android version of ScratchJr. The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr were created by HvingtQuatre Company and Sarah Thomson.
If you enjoy using this free app please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation (www.scratchfoundation.org) a nonprofit organization that provides ongoing support for ScratchJr. We appreciate donations of all sizes large and small.
This version of ScratchJr works only on tablets that are 7-inches or larger and running Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or higher.
With ScratchJr young children (ages 5-7) learn important new skills as they program their own interactive stories and games.
Scratch al Sur 2017 is an opportunity to learn about the importance of introducing programming languages in schools. All lectures and workshops will provide an opportunity to share different experiences from higher levels to those who are beginning to participate in Scratch's global community.

Customizing the list
From this page you can edit a number of files relating to your list among which
typical messages sent to subscribers in particular occasions
welcome message this message is the notice sent to people who just subscribed. You should write a charter for your list and add it in this welcome message. You can create a structured MIME message (reserved to the MIME format experts);
unsubscribe message this message is sent to people unsubscribing from the list;
Sending/receiving
From this page you can decide who will be allowed to post messages on the list.
In the 'Digest frequency' area you can define how frequently compiled messages are sent (Digest and Summary delivery modes) in the list select all the days for which you want digests to be sent. Then choose a delivery time for digests (please avoid choosing a time between 11 p.m. and midnight).
In the 'Available subscription options' list select all the subscriber options you want to offer to your subscribers. By default all options are selected.
The 'Reply address' area allows you to define the default recipients of any reply to a message sent to the list
You can also add the information of your choice in the 'Private information' input box (phone number function etc.); this information will only be accessible by listmasters and list owners with a 'Privileged' profile.
You can change the message delivery mode (the only options available on this page are 'mail' and 'nomail').
The 'Profile' parameter can not be changed the 'Privileged' profile is reserved to the list creator (other owners have a 'Normal' profile).
Be careful becoming owner or moderator of a list does not mean that you are automatically subscribed to that list. Thus owners and moderators have to subscribe themselves to the list.
To delete owners/moderators check the checkbox relating to the person you want to delete and click on the 'Apply modifications' button.
SET list DIGESTPLAIN receive messages in digest mode (plain text)
SET list SUMMARY only receive the message list
SET list NOTICE only receive the message subjects
SET list MAIL normal message delivery mode
SET list CONCEAL become unlisted (hidden subscriber address)
Listmasters
Listmasters are in charge of the management of the mailing list service. Their duties
manage the mailing list server (deployment maintenance etc.);
define the general orientations of the mailing list service
who will be allowed to ask for the creation of a new list
To upload a file on a list do as follows
Browse the folder in which you want to upload your file. Create a new folder if necessary.
Click on the 'Browse' button below the 'Upload a file inside the folder [name of the current folder]' label and choose the file you want to upload; after selecting it click on the 'Open' button. Your file path then displays in the input box close to the 'Browse' button.
Click on the 'Publish' button.
Be careful list owners may define quotas that is to say a maximum size not to be exceeded for the shared document web space. If you try to upload or create a too large document with regard to the space left you will get the following error message "The document repository exceed disk quota".
When attachments are allowed remain reasonable too many or too large attachments may disturb the other subscribers for example by flooding their inboxes.
If you want to share documents with other list members you had probably better upload them in the 'Documents' section of the list.
The use of email in general and for mailing lists is bound by a set of precise rules necessary to share pleasant exchanges the "Netiquette". You will find the general principles of the Netiquette as well as many links on the page of the Wikipedia dedicated to the Netiquette.

Audio filtering failed
Force detection of Dolby Surround
Use this when you know your stream is (or is not) encoded with Dolby Surround but fails to be detected as such. Even if the stream is not actually encoded with Dolby Surround turning on this option might enhance your experience especially when combined with the Headphone Channel Mixer.
Stereo audio output mode
This adds audio post processing filters to modify the sound rendering.
This adds visualization modules (spectrum analyzer etc.).
These options allow you to modify the behavior of the input subsystem such as the DVD or VCD device the network interface settings or the subtitle channel.
File caching (ms)
Caching value for local files in milliseconds.
Live capture caching (ms)
Caching value for cameras and microphones in milliseconds.
This defines the address the RTSP server will listen on along with the base path of the RTSP VOD media. Syntax is address/path. By default the server will listen on any local IP address. Specify an IP address (e.g. 1 or 127.0.0.1) or a host name (e.g. localhost) to restrict them to a specific network interface.
HTTP server port
The HTTP server will listen on this TCP port. The standard HTTP port number is 80. However allocation of port numbers below 1025 is usually restricted by the operating system.
HTTPS server port
The HTTPS server will listen on this TCP port. The standard HTTPS port number is 443. However allocation of port numbers below 1025 is usually restricted by the operating system.
Increase the priority of the process
Increasing the priority of the process will very likely improve your playing experience as it allows VLC not to be disturbed by other applications that could otherwise take too much processor time. However be advised that in certain circumstances (bugs) VLC could take all the processor time and render the whole system unresponsive which might require a reboot of your machine.
Enqueue items into playlist in one instance mode
When using the one instance only option enqueue items to playlist and keep playing current item.
These options define the behavior of the playlist. Some of them can be overridden in the playlist dialog box.

Have you not been able to defeat our foes in all these days? They have summoned reinforcements. Surely now our doom is upon us!
Konrad! We cannot spend any more time here. Though it would be good to defeat the orcs and free more of their prisoners more urgent business calls us!
Delfador thank goodness you have survived! This has been a tough battle but why can we not finish it? Why must we leave?
I must do this? But you are coming with me aren’t you Delfador?
I am afraid not Konrad. I have found some important documents that need seeing to. I must ride at once to make council with the elves. I will meet you in Elensefar after you have secured it.
but one of the orcs survived long enough to send the news to the queen
and she sent her most able commander.
Elmar’s Crossing
Elbridge
Li’sar
We must make haste before the snow overwhelms us!
Victory is ours! We have secured the land from the orcs. Now we can rest here while the cold winter passes.
Let us not rest for too long though friends. We must still reach the ancient dwarven lands before our foes do.
A camp was pitched in a secluded valley that protected its occupants from the worst of the winter weather and roving orc patrols. During this time the valley walls echoed with the squeaks of gryphon hatchlings who happily frolicked across the camp.
Konrad set his shamans to the task of corralling the animals. The elvish shamans had a natural rapport with the gryphlets whose wings were still too small to carry a mount.
Argh! I am vanquished! But at least by worthy foes instead of those disgusting orcs.
Rest in peace Lionel. The poor lost general.
The earth shakes.
How will we make it?
You may now recruit the legendary dwarvish guardsmen!
Thalindil
(exhausted) We have (pant) finally found you!
Rholandir
Lord Kalenz Lord Konrad our forces are nigh! Do not lose hope!
There are some orcs! We must let them fight the men of Wesnoth and avoid engaging them at all costs!
Her reign was long and she undid the evil deeds of her mother.
Konrad became a noble in Li’sar’s court. He married Li’sar and together they had two sons and a daughter.
female^Battle Princess
The rank of Commander is held by those who lead battle groups into combat. Possessing leadership skills they give lower-level units in adjacent hexes improved performance in combat. Commanders are best skilled with the sword although they also carry a bow to use when necessary. If the Commander is lost so is the battle.
female^Dark Queen
Will you?
Yes. The Queen ascended to the throne through the vilest of treachery. However while most of my forces were sent with the King to fight the orcs we have a strong enough contingent here to make the Queen’s forces think twice about attacking Elensefar outright.
We have an uneasy peace until they are done with the smaller villages and finally come around to obtaining my oath. The treaty between Elensefar and Wesnoth is ancient but I am not so naïve as to place my full trust in it. Not in these wicked times.
I am unwilling to start a civil war. I believe the Queen will remain preoccupied with order throughout the kingdom and more importantly with quelling the Northerner threat. We are a matter she will choose to deal with later rather than sooner if she can.
A foolish miscalculation Lord Maddock. These men with which you consort are outlaws and fugitives. They are a well-organized gang of criminals and murderers. We will kill them and then expect your oath of allegiance to Queen Asheviere.
I hope you’re right. In a few hours night will fall and we will find out.
We must be cautious. Look there a substantial orc force is also advancing on Halstead. They must think Wesnoth’s army is spread out right now.
Heh. They’re in for a surprise. This may work to our advantage.
Look in the distance riders approach!

We have all of the silver now all we need is the stone.
Ha! Our reinforcements have arrived. There is no way you can withstand our combined strength!
Exactly! Why would I? And I order you to stay out of the treasury away from that ruby!
You don’t dictate what I am to do Durstorn! I will do as I please and don’t stop me if you want me to make this sceptre.
The ruby is mine and don’t touch it!
Hm a most interesting jewel. I can feel its magical power. I will start drawing up plans for the sceptre immediately.
Now I will need certain materials to make this sceptre.

Durstorn’s rash action led to many problems. Not the least of which was being surrounded by elves.
The dwarves spent several years trapped in those caves the elves besieging them. The dwarves could not leave for there were far too many elves and there was no way out of the caverns other than above ground. But the elves could not enter for the magical dwarven gates were closed.
No that is my friend Krawg. He went with Rugnur into the caves but escaped through a hole in the roof right before the lava filled the cave.
Ya ya! Meh seah za zeptahur. Hrugnaar ha ee. Lozeet enda caav.
What the devil is he saying?
Kreeeeya! Darat! Nomiduun. Bah.
Your advice seems good to me. I will take it. As for you and the gryphon you are free to go. Alanin you’ve served in the army long enough to retire and even if you hadn’t you’ve seen enough combat. So go. Back to your village. You deserve a rest.

I think that your skills may be useful. You may join us.
All I hear are more tree-foes!
That tree it speaks! No— No— We are tree-friends really!
The temple has already been looted but the entrance to its catacombs seems to be blocked by a wall of magical energy.
Stupid stinking trees we’ll show you!
Chop ’em down. It’s cool in these woods I think we need a fire!
We have more pressing matters to deal with before we free that lich.
Afraid you’ll find out you’re not of the line of Kings?
This sounds like a job for Prince Haldric hopefully.
The Lich-Lord is already free.

Ssso humansss you’ve come to trouble usss again. Prepare to die! For the glory of the Lords of Morogor!
Bitey the Serpent
Well it looks like their warriors have given up the fight. We should be able to re-provision the ships now.
The nice thing is they’ll go back to guarding this island after we’re gone for a while. It’ll make a good way of preventing others from following us.
This island is slowly sinking. Hmm I wonder what they’ll do when it gets too small for them?
It isn’t long before Haldric and his companions enter the Brown Hills. An elven guide leads them to a gaping cave mouth and they descend into the darkness.
Hmm Do we really need to know that much about the trolls? I think it’s safe to say that the elves wouldn’t have sent us down here if they were at all friendly.
Fair enough. Well let’s get them!
We have failed More of the trolls’ kin are arriving through the entrance.

The Skeletal Dragon may look like nothing more than a pile of bones but few people who thought that way lived long enough to change their minds.
Has the sky really stopped falling?
I already told you the sky is clear and empty. Now come quickly silly others may need our help.
Wait our keep is just to the east. Our leader Tanuil must surely be recruiting others to help deal with the devastation. Perhaps we should go to the keep before we explore the rest of the village.
But if Tanuil is dead who will lead us?

Searching his castle we found a chest filled with gold.

Elves! Kill them all!
This land belongs to the Black Hand. Trespass and you will die.
There’s no way we can get all our people safely across the desert with outlaws harassing us. We must defeat them before we can continue.
You will never see your champion again. And we will torment his soul for the rest of the eternity.
Don’t listen to them they are powerless in their defeat. Even if Garak fell in battle his soul went to a better place and they can’t reach him there.
Hah now you have learned the flesh is always weaker than the powers of the undead.
My undead zombies shall always defeat the living.
He was as brave and valiant a fighter as I have ever seen in my travels.
But even if we do what about all of our people? How can we safely escort them through this war zone?
We won’t. If we keep the majority of our people hidden back up the passage we should be able to protect them at least for a little while. In the meantime we’ll go ahead and try to sort out this mess. I think you’re right Zhul if we’re lucky we may just be able to negotiate a safe passage out of here.
But they both look evenly matched. Who should we ally with?
Troll Skirmisher
Dwarf Skirmisher
Perhaps they wanted to further test our prowess in battle. And besides every troll we kill is one they don’t have to. Still I think we caused a bigger distraction than they were expecting.
Shhhh you two. Yes of course we would be honored to come and meet your King. But first we left many of our people back up near the entrance to the great cave where you first met us and I fear that even now those caves aren’t safe. Can you help us escort my people to safety?
Hmmmm yes after what you have done I think I could arrange something. We have a few larger halls that should hold your people a bit cramped but safe. Since you first arrived we’ve had a few lads watch over them; you hid your folk in a good defensive location but you can never be too sure. I’ll get them to help escort your people to safety. We certainly wouldn’t want any surprises.
You are full of surprises. But I feel better knowing a few of your kind were watching out for the rest of my people. All right everyone no celebrating yet we still have work left to do!
It’s cooler here there seems to be a draft to the west.

It is clear that this chamber used to be quite ornately decorated but almost all of it has been destroyed revealing a stone and dirt floor. What remains is a large stone throne which has been covered with skulls and animal skins and bright paint. The walls were once covered with frescoes and dwarven runes but several trolls are busy chipping them off. The floor was once tiled in dark slate but only two small patches of tiles remain around the two chairs in this chamber. You’re surprised to see that small tile path running up the center of the chamber has been left untouched. It leads to a small stone chair facing the large throne.
I Great Leader Darmog greet you Kaleh.
I Kaleh leader of the Quenoth Elves thank you for meeting with me.
It wouldn’t have been my first choice. But it could prove useful. I wonder what it likes to eat?
Leave that thing alone.
I never explored this deep into the complex. But every lair has to have a back door somewhere.
Well I refuse to give up. There must be some way out. Search everywhere people.
Ancient Guardian
And what’s the bad news?
The bad news is that I overheard the commander ordering a special group of his men to get ready to ride north and summon reinforcements. It seems that the humans have a bigger village to the north. This outpost is lightly guarded enough that we might be able to defeat them but in our weakened state if they bring the full strength of their army against us I fear we may be crushed.
Then we’ll just have to make sure that no messenger escapes this valley to summon reinforcements.
Undead Emissary
Can’t the dead ever just stay dead? And aren’t they trapped by the flooded tunnels and caves?
We’ll ask later for now we’ve got to keep fighting.
Urruga
Thank you for rescuing me. We’ll show those humans the true fury of the merfolk!
Nuvassa
Thank you for rescuing me. You elves are very skilled at fighting on the dry land. I envy you.
Good for that is just a taste. You are fools to interfere with our affairs and the Iron Council does not tolerate fools. The Dark Lady shall swallow your souls and you shall writhe in eternal torment. Arise my brethren by her power those who have died shall rise up and join us! The very rocks too shall rise up out of the water to aid our crossing. Like a plague we shall pour forth and drive the non-believers before us!
Arisen Warrior
Gosh just when things were starting to calm down.
Before I decide I have just one question How did you merfolk plan on bringing us to meet your master if she dwells far beneath the sea?
Actually we prefer to dwell in the shallow waters where we may frolic in the great coral reefs under the sun and moon. But I digress we realize that you people cannot swim like us and I believe I may have a solution.
I don’t get it. All we see are ruins bones some sand and patches of grass. I thought we would be attacked the moment we set foot on this island. Where is everybody?
You trespass on holy ground The One says you must die!
No you are not The One. You no command Boyicht. Attack!
Fanatical Saurian
My death matters not. The One will kill you all. None can resist her.
If you had told me at the start of our journey the price I was to pay in blood I do not know if I would have had the strength to take that first step. I suppose I should have known that my friends would not let me confront Yechnagoth alone. But I would gladly give up my life today if I could bring Nym back. She followed me faithfully and fought by my side for so long to lose her at the end I wish I could go back and do it all over again.
Although I believe that our battle in the black citadel was our finest hour I am still haunted by Nym’s death in that dark place. And so every morning at sunrise I come out to the southeastern tip of the island and look out upon the waters upon the world that we sacrificed so much to preserve. I remind myself what Zhul said and they all believed that despite all the death and fighting we saw in our journey this world was a beautiful and good enough place that Nym was willing to sacrifice her life to save it. Looking out over the waters and back upon the prosperity of my people I tell myself it was worth it. But sometimes that seems a small consolation.

We carried Nym to a small island to the north which had a single peak with a beautiful view of the surrounding islands. It seemed to me to be a lookout that Nym would appreciate. So I and a few others climbed to the top of the peak and dug a grave for Nym so that she might always look down upon us and see all that we accomplished with her gift. For she gave us the gift of life and every day I strive to make the most use of it I can. I will always remember her. Nym who was with me ever since I was a child and during every step of the journey who was always faithful but never hesitated to speak her mind who managed to crack a joke no matter how grim the situation. How I miss her laugh her smile her

A few miles in front of Gerion Coast lies a small unnamed island. Until now you have not seen any reason to sail there but yesterday a big fireball came from the sky and touched down in its center. Is this a sign of the Gods? You believe it is and you hope that your tribe will find the treasure of this island before other tribes will follow.
Red player is close to the ores but has little fertile terrain. Yellow player has plenty of good land but must move far from his starting position to find ores. Blue player takes the middle ground – he has some fertile land and is not too far away from the resources.
Long after a meteor crashed into a couple of mountains life blossoms in the crater. Two tribes are now fighting for the rich resources.
Crossing the Horizon
The world is not enough! If you want to win you have to send some ships. But remember your opponents are very close to you.
Wisent Valley
It seems as if this magical valley has been inhabited by wisents since the beginning of days. When your tribe came to this place you were sure that it offered enough space for a peaceful life. But can your tribe live in peace with your neighbors?
The black player is surrounded in the center with no resources so there are three different ways to use this map without the black player for a normal 4 players’ map with a black AI to add a complication to the expansion of the other players or you can play as a challenge with the black player against the other 4 (VERY difficult).
Welcome to Island Hopping
May Satul warm you Jundlina! The most important things for building a settlement are the building materials. There are some trees here so we should build housings for some woodcutters and of course also for foresters so we will not run out of trees. Oh and we mustn’t forget the sawmill for most buildings can’t be made out of logs alone. Stronger buildings also need granite but there is plenty to the north-east of here; we just need to build a quarry and my stonemasons will go to work promptly.
Sidolus Speaks
May Satul warm you Jundlina! I agree with what Loftomor proposes. We need a good supply of building materials for we have to expand our territory swiftly. I will not feel safe on this island as long as we have not seen all its shores. I brought plenty of good men from Atlantis. The military might is available. We only need some housing to live in.
Jundlina is Satisfied
Jundlina’s Memoirs
The iron ore your miners dig up is not usable yet – it has to be melted into iron first.
Enhance buildings and build a micro brewery
Enhance a mine and the tavern and build a micro brewery.
Enhance the coal mine or the iron mine to a deep mine and enhance the tavern to an inn.
Also build a micro brewery.
So now that we have both the mines and the food to sustain them we should bring what our brave miners gain for us into a more useful state. The iron ore has to be melted into iron so that it is ready to be forged into whatever we want. And we need the coal to keep the smelter’s ovens burning.
Khantrukh speaks
Our miners are digging up less and less by the day! We have to go deeper closer to the mountain’s core if we want more of its treasures!
Of course it is dark and cold in such depths and only a few venture voluntarily into these places. We should reward this bravery with greater rations for them. And a pint of beer or two will keep their spirits high.
Boldreth seems concerned
Khantrukh has just informed me that our basic food economy was built up successfully. Finally none of us has to fear starvation anymore.
Thron told me that he discovered tracks in the snow to the northeast of our settlement. He has instructed us to build a tower to have a greater visual range over the area around our hall to protect our people from sudden attacks.
Further Exploration
The first fortification Thron ordered has just been completed. At the moment he seeks to bring trust and belief to those who live inside the walls of our new habitat that we named ‘Ondun’ which means ‘those who wait’ in the old tongue. But Thron is not yet satisfied – and I fully understand his fears the forests are deep and the frontier to Al’thunran is near. I am sure that there are a thousand greater dangers out there than the unknown tracks.
To overlook more of the area around our hall we should explore further and set up more guards and scouts to observe the frontier and keep an eye on the raging wars on our doorstep. THEN we will be prepared once trouble seeks to capture our woods.
Build a stonemason’s house and mining infrastructure
Stonemason’s house and Mining Infrastructure
Build a stonemason’s house and then a complete mining and production infrastructure (coal mine and / or charcoal kiln iron mine toolsmithy weapon smithy armor smithy and smelting works).
Food For Your Miners
Build a tavern to produce some food to sustain our miners.
Gold Production
Produce at least six bars of gold to be able to colonize your vicinity.
Defeat the Barbarians
Defeat the Enemy
End the Barbarians’ existence in this part of the world.
Amalea’s Excited
Amalea is looking forward to the exploration
Lutius. We have made so much progress so far. I am glad to hear that we have many ships now.
Now that our fleet is growing and growing we should discover the complete region. Let’s try to find more land and eventually get more resources.
It would be especially helpful to find more marble either within fields of rock or in the mountains to mine it.
The Battle is Won
Praise the gods we have succeeded. We managed all the challenges that were imposed on us. We even expelled the Barbarians out of our country. However our victory is only temporary as this is still just the beginning of the war. Let’s see what the future still holds for us.
Lutius is disappointed
Oh no! Amalea is right. In fact I can’t see any productivity at all. And the road network seems to be completely in shambles as well. Who might be responsible for this chaos?
Explanation Needed
Therefore I took the freedom to restrict our current building options to the lumberjack’s house until we have gained enough building materials by dismantling the ineffective buildings.
Amalea Reminds to Clear Road Network
Amalea reminds Lutius of the scrambled road network
Look Brother I have just realized we haven’t cleared the road network yet. I think we should do so very quickly to free enough space for new buildings.
To achieve this we should make sure that there aren’t more than three dead ends (flags with only one road) and not more than one flag with more than four roads attached.
You can build the port either on the easternmost tip of the island or in the place where the enemy’s headquarters stood.
Welcome to the beautiful isle of Langeness! I am Reebaud the chieftain of this pristine island.
My tribe and I have just arrived from the mainland. There were fights with the Danes in the North the Schauenburgers and Holsteiners in the East and South So I decided to lead my tribe away to start a quiet peaceful life on this untouched island.
A new home
This is as good a place as any to start building our new home. First of all we must ensure a stable supply of basic building materials.
Build a basic economy
Supply All Basic Materials
Build a quarry a reed farm a clay pit a well a charcoal kiln a brick kiln and houses for a woodcutter and a forester.
Expand to the south
Expand Your Territory to Explore the South
As for expansion – I wonder how strictly he can possibly control us. Perhaps we should send a scout to spy on him
The Scout Discovered Something
Our scout returned
Chieftain Reebaud! Our scout just returned. He has found a poem in the strange tongue this Proconsul speaks. With some difficulty I have translated it into our language. If I did not mistranslate it runs as follows
I don’t know what it means but I’m sure it’s important. Perhaps you can make some sense of it.
How to Build a Quarry
Build a quarry next to those rocks here. Remember how I did it earlier?
Make sure that you are showing the building spaces then just click on the space where you want the building to be choose it from the window that appears and it is placed. Maybe this is a good time to explain about all those building space symbols we activated earlier.
You can build four things on fields in Widelands flags small houses medium houses and big houses. But not every field can hold everything. The build space symbols ease recognition
Everything can be built on the green house symbol.
One of these training sites is the battle arena. It is a big and expensive building and it trains soldiers in evade. Since soldiers get very hungry during their workout this building needs a lot of food and strong beer. In a real game you should have a good infrastructure before you build it.
To see evade training in action build a battle arena.
While we’re waiting for the battle arena you’ll probably notice some soldiers walking around. They are automatically exchanged from time to time. I’ll teach you about that later.
Build a battle arena
Build a battle arena. It is a big building.
You need to stop your shipyard when you have enough ships. Otherwise your shipwright will consume all your logs and spidercloth producing dozens of ships.
This is the icon for stopping production. You will find it in the building window.
Construct two ships
Ships are constructed automatically when the shipyard is complete and the needed wares have been delivered.
Wait until the shipwright has constructed two ships.
Look up which wares are needed to recruit soldiers
A soldier needs a wooden spear and a helmet – from there on out you can search backwards to find the wares and the buildings you need to supply your barracks where the soldier is recruited. When you are finished just close the encyclopedia window.
Use the encyclopedia to find out how to create new soldiers.
Choose the ‘Wares’ tab in the encyclopedia window.
Look up what is needed to produce a helmet and what is needed to produce a wooden spear.

Digs iron ore out of the ground in mountain terrain.
Grinds blackroots and corn to produce blackroot flour and cornmeal respectively.
When no cornmeal is required the mill will try to produce blackroot flour even when there is no demand for it.
Cuts blocks of granite out of rocks in the vicinity.
The quarry needs rocks to cut within the work area.

‘Fresh from the countryside Bread fish or game to go.’
Cultivates reed that serves three different purposes for the Frisians.
Reed is the traditional material for roofing. It is also needed for producing buckets and fishing nets and it is woven – together with reindeer fur – into the cloth used for ships’ sails.
Who says a beast of burden cannot be useful for other things than transport?
The reindeer breeder who first proposed using reindeer fur for clothing
Breeds strong reindeer for adding them to the transportation system. Also keeps them for their fur which is turned into armor and cloth.

The helmet is the basic defense of a warrior. It is produced in an armor smithy. In combination with a wooden spear it is the equipment to fit out young soldiers. Helmets are also used in training camps – together with food – to train soldiers from health level 0 to level 1.
The ax is the basic weapon of the Barbarians. All young soldiers are equipped with it.
This is a dangerous weapon the Barbarians are able to produce. It is produced in the war mill. Only trained soldiers are able to wield such a weapon. It is used – together with food – in the training camp to train soldiers from attack level 3 to 4.
The broad ax is produced by the ax workshop and the war mill. It is used in the training camp – together with food – to train soldiers with a fundamental fighting knowledge from attack level 1 to attack level 2.
The bronze ax is considered a weapon that is hard to handle. Only skilled soldiers can use it. It is produced at the war mill and used in the training camp – together with food – to train soldiers from attack level 2 to level 3.
Iron ore is mined in iron mines.
It is smelted in a smelting works to retrieve the iron.
It is smelted in a furnace to retrieve the iron.
Kitchen tools are needed for preparing rations snacks and meals. Be sure to have a metal workshop to produce this basic tool (but it ceases to be produced by the building if it is enhanced to an ax workshop and war mill).
Kitchen tools are needed for preparing rations and meals. The smoker also needs them.

This release fixes a problem with detecting DVD drive locations.
This release features the completed transition to the Gtk+3 toolkit improvements in the user-interface (more streamlined menus) better playlists. Furthermore existing plugins have been improved and a new one has been added (MPRIS2). Most of the artwork has been updated for this release and we use the GStreamer1.0 framework now by default.

Mousepad aims to be an easy-to-use and fast editor. Our target is an editor for quickly editing text files not a development environment or an editor with a huge bunch of plugins.
On the other hand we try to use the latest Gtk+ features available which means that if Gtk adds something new in a major release that is useful for the editor we will likely bump the Gtk dependency and integrate this new feature in Mousepad.

I don't know much now but I'll tell you when I do.
It's a great power and gift to those who can use it.
Why are you trying to hurt me Dink?
I'd best not venture so far from town.  Too dangerous!
Hey that's an AlkTree.
I'm full!  I can't pick up anything else.
That place is far to the west how'd you get out here?

Since my little girl was kidnapped I've sort of let things go.
Kidnapped?!  Why aren't the townspeople forming a search party?
I've seen a lot of monsters around lately though

The outside edges of your thumbs rest over the space bar.
The part of the hands closest to the wrist (the base) rest over the table outside the keyboard. Without this kind of support the arms would quickly tire.
This is referred to as the home position for the hands. From it the fingers move all over the keyboard reaching all the keys as naturally and quickly as possible. To reach this goal one uses a specific relation between each key and finger. This relation will be learned gradually as you complete the basic course.
When learning the relation between fingers and keys it is very important that you only move the finger which must press the key and allow all other fingers to remain in the home position.
After memorizing this relationship you can relax the previous rule some so that you can attain greater speed while typing.

The questions made by this exercise are at the moment made by selecting rhythm elements randomly. This is not the best way to do it and we hope a more clever way of generating questions will be made in a later release.
Tap the rhythm
Screenshot of the rhythmtapping.
The program will play a randomly generated rhythm and the user should reproduce the rhythm. The user enters the rhythm by tapping on the button labeled Tap here.
The profile manager let multiple Solfege users share a login on your operating system. The profiles will share the config file but they will have separate statistics and test results.
Minor becomes major.
Perfect stays perfect.
Major becomes minor.
Augmented becomes diminished.
Below are two examples a major third is inverted and becomes a minor sixth and a minor seventh is inverted and becomes a major second.

Btrfs RAID levelsBtrfs supports the following RAID levels for both data and metadataDUP stores two copies of each piece of data on the same device. This is similar to RAID1 and protects against block-level errors on the device but does not provide any guarantees if the device fails. Only one device must be be selected to use DUP.SINGLE stores a single copy of each piece of data. Btrfs requires a minimum of one device to use SINGLE.RAID0 provides no form of error recovery but stripes a single copy of data across multiple devices for performance purpose. Btrfs requires a minimum of two devices to use RAID0.RAID1 stores two complete copies of each piece of data. Each copy is stored on a different device. Btrfs requires a minimum of two devices to use RAID1.RAID10 stores two complete copies of each piece of data and also stripes each copy across multiple devices for performance. Btrfs requires a minimum of five devices to use RAID10
When the default RAID level is used Btrfs will select a RAID level depending on whether the filesystem is being created on top of multiple devices or using only one device. For a single-device Btrfs the tool also will distinguish between rotational or not-rotational devices to choose the default value.
Stride Length in Blocks
Enter a number that is at least 1 or 'none'.
Set the the number of blocks in a RAID stripe. This is the number of blocks read or written to disk before moving to the next disk (also referred to as the chunk size). Valid values are numbers greater than 0 or 'none'.
Enable Regular Checks
Enable regular file system checks at booting. This option forces a file system check after 30 system starts or 180 days whichever comes first.

Cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them and give it a value which is the average of the other four plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation.

In April 1997 Sir Roger Penrose a British math professor who has worked with Stephen Hawking on such topics as relativity black holes and whether time has a beginning filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kimberly-Clark Corporation which Penrose said copied a pattern he created (a pattern demonstrating that "a nonrepeating pattern could exist in nature") for its Kleenex quilted toilet paper. Penrose said he doesn't like litigation but "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm then a last stand must be taken."

Your memory capacity is above 3 GiB (assuming the Server is on localhost) so MySQL might not be able to access all of your memory. You might want to consider installing the 64-bit version of MySQL.
Query caching method
Suboptimal caching method.
You are using the MySQL Query cache with a fairly high traffic database. It might be worth considering to use memcached instead of the MySQL Query cache especially if you have multiple slaves.
Cached queries are removed due to low query cache memory from the query cache.
You might want to increase {querycachesize} however keep in mind that the overhead of maintaining the cache is likely to increase with its size so do this in small increments and monitor the results.
Query cache max size
The query cache size is above 128 MiB. Big query caches may cause significant overhead that is required to maintain the cache.
Depending on your environment it might be performance increasing to reduce this value.
