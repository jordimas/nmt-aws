Username for connecting to a calibre Content server
Password for connecting to a calibre Content server. To read the password from standard input use the special value {0}. To read the password from a file use {1} (i.e. ). The angle brackets in the above are required remember to escape them or use quotes for your shell.

Another calibre program such as {} or the main calibre program is running. Having multiple programs that can make changes to a calibre library running at the same time is a bad idea. calibredb can connect directly to a running calibre content server to make changes through it instead. See the documentation of the {} option for details.

Identifiers
When searching for text without using lookup prefixes as for example Red instead of titleRed limit the columns searched to those named below.
Choose columns to be searched when not using prefixes as for example when searching for Red instead of titleRed. Enter a list of search/lookup names separated by commas. Only takes effect if you set the option to limit search columns above.
Characters typed in the search box will match their accented versions based on the language you have chosen for the calibre interface. For example in English searching for n will match both {} and n but if your language is Spanish it will only match n. Note that this is much slower than a simple search on very large libraries. Also this option will have no effect if you turn on case-sensitive searching

A "WYSIWYG" (What You See Is What You Get) is a rich-text editor like a mini word-processor for editing HTML content in CiviCRM.
Select 'CKEditor' for the built-in WYSIWYG option. You can customize the toolbar buttons and other settings by clicking "Configure CKEditor."
Select 'Textarea' if you want users to type text and/or HTML code into plain text fields.
Other WYSIWYG editors are available for download from the CiviCRM Extension Directory.
In order to use this functionality the installation's database user must have privileges to create triggers (in MySQL 5.0 – and in MySQL 5.1 if binary logging is enabled – this means the SUPER privilege). This install either does not seem to have the required privilege enabled.
This functionality cannot be enabled on multilingual installations.
If enabled CiviCRM sends PDF receipt as an attachment during event signup or online contribution.
wkhtmltopdf is an alternative utility for generating PDF's which may provide better performance especially if you are generating a large number of PDF letters or receipts. Your system administrator will need to download and install this utility and enter the executable path here.
If enabled CiviCRM will allow users to submit profiles from external sites. This is disabled by default to limit abuse.

Use the greeting/address options to determine how you would like the contact's salutation and name displayed for different communication methods. When you send an email or export a list of records to a .csv file for mail merging the greeting and addressee fields will reflect your preferences.
CiviCRM will attempt to split street addresses into separate elements (street number street name and unit/apt) to help you make lists and reports where you need to sort by street number (and/or separate addresses with odd and even numbers). For most addresses this is done for you automatically. However you can manually edit these elements and potentially handle addresses that are in unusual formats by clicking 'Edit Address Elements'.
Street Editing
Click here to return to editing the street address as a single field. Addresses which don't fit the expected format for address elements can still be saved by entering them in the single 'Street Address' field.
You can select an existing organization record here OR type in the name of a new organization if this person's employer is not already in your database. However if you want this person to share their work address with their employer AND that organization doesn't exist yet - leave this field blank and use the Shared Address feature in the Address pane below to create the employer record AND enter the employer address. The 'current employer' relationship will be automatically created for you.

Re-Use
However if the same email is used by multiple contacts that email address will receive multiple copies of the email -- one for each contact using that address.
Selecting this option will ensure only one email is sent to each address. Note that when using this option and including contact tokens in your email content the email with it's respective tokens will only be created for one of the matching contacts.
Determine the contacts in your database who should receive this mailing by first selecting one or more Included Groups. (Groups must be assigned the Mailing List type to be available on this screen - you can update this for an existing group from Manage Groups raquo; Settings.)
You also have the option to Exclude some contacts from your included groups by selecting one or more Excluded Groups. Contacts who are in both groups will NOT receive the mailing (they are 'excluded').
If you have sent other mailings - you can additionally Include (or Exclude) contacts who received those mailings. CiviCRM will eliminate any duplications so that contacts who are in an Included Group AND were recipients of an Included Mailing will only be sent one copy of this mailing.

The B program is in charge of updating both the PO files (to sync them to the original documents) and the translated documents (to sync them to the PO files). The main point is to make the use of po4a easier without having to remember of the command line options.
It also allows you to mix documents having different formats into the same POT file so that you can have only one such file per project.
Supported formats
Currently this approach has been successfully implemented to several kinds of text formatting formats
pod
This is the Perl Online Documentation format. The language and extensions themselves are documented that way as well as most of the existing Perl scripts. It makes easy to keep the documentation close to the actual code by embedding them both in the same file. It makes programmer life easier but unfortunately not the translator one.
sgml
Professional translator tools sometimes split the document at the sentence level in order to maximize the reusability of previous translations and speed up their process.  The problem is that the same sentence may have several translations depending on the context.
Paragraphs are by definition longer than sentences. It will hopefully ensure that having the same paragraph in two documents will have the same meaning (and translation) regardless of the context in each case.
Splitting on smaller parts than the sentence would be B. It would be a bit long to explain why here but interested reader can refer to the L man page (which comes with the Perl documentation) for example. To make short each language has its specific syntactic rules and there is no way to build sentences by aggregating parts of sentences working for all existing languages (or even for the 5 of the 10 most spoken ones or even less).
At the first glance gettext doesn't seem to be adapted to all kind of translations.  For example it didn't seem adapted to debconf the interface all Debian packages use for their interaction with the user during installation. In that case the texts to translate were pretty short (a dozen lines for each package) and it was difficult to put the translation in a specialized file since it has to be available before the package installation.
That's why the debconf developer decided to implement another solution where translations are placed in the same file than the original. This is rather appealing. One would even want to do this for XML for example. It would look like that
So the man parser implemented in po4a have some known limitations we are not really inclined to correct and which will constitute some pitfalls you'll have to avoid if you want to see translators taking care of your documentation.
Don't program in nroff
nroff is a complete programming language with macro definition conditionals and so on. Since this parser isn't a fully featured nroff interpreter it will fail on pages using these facilities (There are about 200 such pages on my box).
Use the plain macro set
There are still some macros which are not supported by po4aman. This is only because I failed to find any documentation about them. Here is the list of unsupported macros used on my box. Note that this list isn't exhaustive since the program fails on the first encountered unsupported macro. If you have any information about some of these macros I'll happily add support for them. Because of these macros about 250 pages on my box are inaccessible to po4aman.
There are some options (described in the next section) that can customize this behavior.  If this doesn't fit to your document format you're encouraged to write your own module derived from this to describe your format's details.  See the section B below for the process description.
Comma-separated list of environments which should not be re-wrapped.
Note that there is a difference between verbatim and nowrap environments.  There is no command and comments analysis in verbatim blocks.
Colon-separated list of files that should not be included by \input and \include.
Using these options permits to override the behaviour of the commands defined in the default lists.
Please refer to L for more information on what addenda are and how translators should write them. To apply an addendum to the translated document simply pass its filename to this function and you are done ;)
This function returns a non-null integer on error.

The maximum number of items indexed in each pass of a cron maintenance task. If necessary reduce the number of items to prevent timeouts and memory errors while indexing.
Indexing settings
Changing the settings below will cause the site index to be rebuilt. The search index is not cleared but systematically updated to reflect the new settings. Searching will continue to work but new content won't be indexed until all existing content has been re-indexed.The default settings should be appropriate for the majority of sites.
Minimum word length to index
The number of characters a word has to be to be indexed. A lower setting means better search result ranking but also a larger database. Each search query must contain at least one keyword that is this size (or longer).

Contact @username
The Contact module allows visitors to contact site administrators and other users. Users specify a subject write their message and can have a copy of their message sent to their own e-mail address. For more information see the online handbook entry for Contact module.
User contact forms
Site users can be contacted with a user contact form that keeps their e-mail address private. Users may enable or disable their personal contact forms by editing their My account page. If enabled a Contact tab leads to a personal contact form displayed on their user profile. Site administrators are still able to use the contact form even if has been disabled. The Contact tab is not shown when you view your own profile.
All roles for this text format must be enabled and cannot be changed.
Filter processing order
Text formats
The Filter module allows administrators to configure text formats. A text format defines the HTML tags codes and other input allowed in content and comments and is a key feature in guarding against potentially damaging input from malicious users. For more information see the online handbook entry for Filter module.
Applying filters to text
Describing its appearance eg. square-85x85
Attaching images to content as fields
Image module also allows you to attach images to content as fields. To add an image field to a content type go to the content type's manage fields page and add a new field of type Image. Attaching images to content this way allows image styles to be applied and maintained and also allows you more flexibility when theming.
Image styles commonly provide thumbnail sizes by scaling and cropping images but can also add various effects before an image is displayed. When an image is displayed with a style a new file is created and the original image is left unchanged.
Administer image styles
When new content is created the Node module records basic information about the content including the author date of creation and the Content type. It also manages the publishing options which define whether or not the content is published promoted to the front page of the site and/or sticky at the top of content lists. Default settings can be configured for each type of content on your site.
Creating custom content types
The Node module gives users with the Administer content types permission the ability to create new content types in addition to the default ones already configured. Creating custom content types allows you the flexibility to add fields and configure default settings that suit the differing needs of various site content.
Administering content
The Content administration page allows you to review and bulk manage your site content.
Administer tests

The User module allows users to register log in and log out. It also allows users with proper permissions to manage user roles (used to classify users) and permissions associated with those roles. For more information see the online handbook entry for User module.
Creating and managing users
The User module allows users with the appropriate permissions to create user accounts through the People administration page where they can also assign users to one or more roles and block or delete user accounts. If allowed users without accounts (anonymous users) can create their own accounts on the Create new account page.

@nodetype comment
Content-related actions on your site (creating editing or deleting content and comments) automatically cause affected content items to be marked for indexing or reindexing at the next cron run. When content is marked for reindexing the previous content remains in the index until cron runs at which time it is replaced by the new content. Unlike content-related actions actions related to the structure of your site do not cause affected content to be marked for reindexing. Examples of structure-related actions that affect content include deleting or editing taxonomy terms enabling or disabling modules that add text to content (such as Taxonomy Comment and field-providing modules) and modifying the fields or display parameters of your content types. If you take one of these actions and you want to ensure that the search index is updated to reflect your changed site structure you can mark all content for reindexing by clicking the "Re-index site" button on the Search settings page. If you have a lot of content on your site it may take several cron runs for the content to be reindexed.

Fedora Flavors
Fedora provides three primary flavors tailored for some specific use cases.  offers Fedora Cloud for scalable infrastructure Fedora Server for organizational infrastructure and Fedora Workstation for the developer and desktop user.
For alternative desktop environments or media built for more niche purposes check out Fedora Spins.

Automatic upgrade using FedUp
The preferred way to upgrade your system is an automatic upgrade using the FedUp utility. For information on performing an automatic upgrade see .
You can upgrade to the latest version of Fedora manually instead of relying on FedUp. This involves booting the installer as if you were performing a clean installation letting it detect your existing Fedora system and overwriting the root partition while preserving data on other partitions and volumes. The same process can also be used to reinstall the system if you need to. For detailed information see .
The Fedora Project offers different flavors for tailored for some specific use cases. Choose the Fedora flavor best for you or you can build your own by customizing after the installation or by using a kickstart file as described in .
Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications or frameworks. It abstracts CPU memory storage and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual) enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively. Apache Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g. Hadoop Spark Kafka Elastic Search) with APIs for resource management and scheduling across entire data center and cloud environments.
Apache Oozie
Apache Oozie is a workflow scheduler to manage Hadoop jobs. It is integrated with the rest of the Hadoop stack and supports several types of Hadoop jobs out of the box (such as Java map-reduce Streaming map-reduce Pig Hive Sqoop and Distcp) as well as system specific jobs (such as Java programs and shell scripts).
Apache Pig
Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization which in turn enables them to handle very large data sets. At the present time Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs for which large-scale parallel implementations already exist (e.g. the Hadoop sub-project).
Support for Object Oriented Programming
The commands of the TclOO package are now part of the TCL language itself. This gives TCL a built-in fully dynamic class-based object system and also includes advanced features such as meta-classes filters and mixins.
A new version 4 of the popular package Itcl (also known as "incr TCL") is also included now built on a TclOO foundation granting support for some traditional Object Oriented TCL programming out of the box as well.
Support for multi-thread operations
A thread-enabled default build a bundled Thread package and a new command interp cancel enable multi-threaded programming tasks on TCL 8.6.
The autofs package has gained support for amd format automount maps. In the past amd maps have been handled by the am-utils package which has seen declining upstream development. Those that use amd format automount maps are encouraged to test the autofs functionality and report any issues or feature requests at 
For usage information refer to /usr/share/doc/autofs/README.amd-maps.
Hardware Overview
Fedora PRODVER; provides software to suit a wide variety of applications. The storage memory and processing requirements vary depending on usage. For example a high traffic database server requires much more memory and storage than a business desktop which in turn has higher requirements than a single-purpose virtual machine.

SystemTap
GPO policy settings are commonly used to manage host-based access control in an AD environment. SSSD supports local logons remote logons service logons and more. Each of these standard GPO security options can be mapped to any PAM service allowing administrators to comprehensively configure their systems.
This enhancement to SSSD is related only to the retrieval and enforcement of AD policy settings. Administrators can continue to use the existing AD tool set to specify policy settings.
The new functionality only affects SSSD's AD provider and has no effect on any other SSSD providers (e.g. IPA provider). By default SSSD's AD provider will be installed in "permissive" mode so that it won't break upgrades. Administrators will need to set "enforcing" mode manually (see sssd-ad(5)).

Packages that can be downloaded from koji build system do not contain signatures so you should use them with caution.  Similarly bleeding-edge packages in Rawhide are not necessarily signed.
Importing keys
The keys are included in the fedora-release package you can find them in the /etc/pki/rpm-gpg directory.  Please note that not all keys in this directory are used by Fedora project -- some are used for signing Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages or are no longer used at all. If you use Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages see https//www.redhat.com/security/team/key.  The keys used by Fedora are enabled in the yum repository configuration so you generally don't need to manually import them into the rpm database.
In addition to the fedora-release package and this web page you can download the Fedora keys from a public key server such as keys.gnupg.net.
For some repositories such as repositories with stable and testing packages in default configuration yum is able to find a proper key for the repository and asks the user for confirmation before importing the key if the key is not already imported into the rpm database.

Tutorials tips and tricks to make your Fedora experience awesome!

Do it with Fedora
In this series of tutorials we'll walk you through fun projects you can create using Fedora.
The one file format that can be problematic is Flash files. The free software world does not yet have an editor that can open up Flash source files. For once though I'm with Apple in hoping Flash becomes less relevant as HTML5 and javascript-based frameworks become more and more prevalent.
Do you have any tips for enthusiastic future designers in using Fedora to create awesome interface designs?
I guess my best tip would be 'keep an open mind.' Pretty much everything you do using a Mac or Windows using proprietary apps is possible in Fedora. Sometimes things might work a bit differently than you are accustomed to (I'm looking at you Gimp!) but all the functionality you need is there and you'll find that the communities around these design applications are really large and rich and there's tons of tutorials videos and assets like brushes and palettes available for these applications.
My second tip is - try out the the Fedora Design Suite. This is a special edition of Fedora that has many great free  open source creative apps pre-installed for you to discover!
There's a great annual conference called Libre Graphics Meeting where the users of these free creative tools and the developers that create them get together for a few days and talk about the interesting things they're accomplishing using the apps and the future roadmaps for the apps. It's a really energizing event and that community is a great place to find out about new apps coming out and hidden treasures in the feature set of the apps. You'll want to at least check out the materials from that conference (there are full videos of many of the sessions from the last one available online) if not take a trip and see and learn for yourself!
What you'll want to do first is to transcribe any of your master to-do / waiting on / someday tasks lists from your current filing system - perhaps a paper notebook - and create a Gnote note for each. If you don't have any pre-existing lists here's a basic process for creating them
Go through any notes emails and papers you might have and your brain and write down everything you need to do. Groceries projects at work phone calls to make - all is fair game. Jot it all down in one Gnote note; title the note "Master To-Do List." I recommend using a bulleted list format - simply add a "*" character before your first entry in the note and hit enter to continue on to the next bulleted item.
Create two more Gnote notes one titled "Someday To-Do List" and one titled "Waiting On To-Do List."
Start going through your list item-by-item For each item decide if it is something you need to do in the immediate future something that you'd like to get done but have no immediate plans to get done and things you're involved with but are in someone else's hands now.
For items that you have no immediate plans to get done remove them from the "Master To-Do List" Gnote and paste them into the "Someday To-Do List" note.

This button allows you to browse for an existing Live CD ISO that you have previously downloaded.  If you do not select one a release will be downloaded for you automatically.

This is the USB stick that you want to install your Live CD on.  This device must be formatted with the FAT filesystem.
Target Device
Line 2 3 and 4 check the key fingerprint of the remote host against local copies if they exist in the /home/user1/.ssh/knownhosts file. If none exist for this host as occurs in the above example the user is then prompted after displaying the fingerprint whether or not to add this record in the same knownhosts file by entering yes or no.
Line 5 displays the result in this case that the fingerprint has been added to the local file. This mapping will be used in the future when connecting to this host.
Line 6 in this example shows where the password for user1@foo.example.com is entered.
Line 7 shows the prompt of the remote machine after authentication has been successful. At this point no matter what authentication technique is in use the user has access to the remote machine and it can be configured as though it were a local connection. Of course the limit of what the user has access to on the remote machine is still dependent on regular permissions and controls.
The following can happen and is possibly not good TBD..

Individual pieces of SSSD functionality are provided by special SSSD services that are started and stopped together with SSSD.  The services are managed by a special service frequently called monitor. The [sssd] section is used to configure the monitor as well as some other important options like the identity domains.

FILES
If a password reset by root fails because the corresponding SSSD provider does not support password resets an individual message can be displayed. This message can e.g. contain instructions about how to reset a password.
The message is read from the file pamssspwresetmessage.LOC where LOC stands for a locale string returned by  setlocale3 . If there is no matching file the content of pamssspwresetmessage.txt is displayed. Root must be the owner of the files and only root may have read and write permissions while all other users must have only read permissions.
These files are searched in the directory /etc/sssd/customize/DOMAINNAME/. If no matching file is present a generic message is displayed.

This scene-referred interpolated raw file from the PhotoFlow raw processor (which provides a GIMP plug-in for easy opening of raw files) has out-of-display-range RGB channel values that will be brought back into the display range by doing “Colors/Auto/Stretch Contrast”.
After doing “Colors/Auto/Stretch Contrast” shadows are lighter and highlights are darker because the dynamic range has been compressed to fit within the display range. This looks like an editing step in the wrong direction! but actually it’s necessary.
Here’s the final “Power lines” image after tone mapping the scene-referred interpolated raw file using the procedure described in this tutorial.
As captured by the raw file this picture of power lines marching into the distance is a typical result of taking a photograph at noon on a bright sunny day The sky and clouds looked pretty good right out of the camera but the ground was far too dark. So the image could benefit from some tone mapping to raise the shadows and midtones. The first step is to do “Colors/Auto/Stretch Contrast” to bring any channel values that are less than 0.0f or greater than 1.0f back within the display range of 0.0 to 1.0 floating point.
Performing “Auto/Stretch Contrast” to bring the channel values back inside the display range doesn’t exactly look like an editing step in the right direction for tone-mapping this particular image! but really it is. Using “Colors/Exposure” to add positive exposure compensation to the shadows and midtones won’t work if the image has channel values that fall outside the display range.
The Very Beginning
According to Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball the original creators of GIMP in their announcement of GIMP 0.54
The GIMP arose from the ashes of a hideously crafted CS164 (compilers) class project. The setting early morning. We were both weary from lack of sleep and the terrible strain of programming a compiler in LISP. The limits of our patience had long been exceeded and yet still the dam held.
And then it happened. Common LISP messily dumped core when it could not allocate the 17 MB it needed to generate a parser for a simple grammar using yacc. An unbelieving moment passed there was one shared look of disgust and then our project was vapor. We had to write something ANYTHING  useful. Something in C. Something that did not rely on nested lists to represent a bitmap. Thus the GIMP was born.
Like the phoenix glorious new life sprung out of the burnt remnants of LISP and yacc. Ideas went flying decisions were made the GIMP began to take form.
To further enhances scripting abilities API changes to support layer groups have been made.

Foreground Select Tool
Selecting individual objects on images is easier now with a new foreground select tool. It is done in two steps. First you make select region of interest which contains the entire object. Then you paint over selected area with a brush not crossing object’s border. Release mouse button when you’re done and look if there are dark blue spots on your objects. If there are some paint with a brush over them again and release to refine selection. When there are no more blue areas inside the object press Enter and there you have a perfectly selected object.
Align Tool
While GIMP has provided a grid and guideline functionality the actual alignment of objects had to be done manually. A new tool comes at rescue 
Changes in menus
Text Context Menu
Text Editing Context Menu
You get this menu by right-clicking on text. It is somewhat different from that of the Text Editor dialog.
Cut Copy Paste Delete these options concern a selected text. They remain grayed out as long as no text is selected. Paste is activated if the clipboard is full of text.
Open text file this command opens a file browser where you can find the wanted text file.
You can think of layers as a stack of slides. Using layers you can construct an image of several conceptual parts each of which can be manipulated without affecting any other part of the image. Layers are stacked on top of each other. The bottom layer is the background of the image and the components in the foreground of the image come above it.
An image with layers
Layers of the image
Resulting image
There is no limit in principle to the number of layers an image can have only the amount of memory available on the system. It is not uncommon for advanced users to work with images containing dozens of layers. You can group layers to make your work easier and you have many commands to handle layers.
GIMP uses plugins for reading and writing all file formats except XCF. These plugins may use external libraries or programs. For example GIMP does not directly support PostScript. Instead for reading (or writing) PostScript files (file extension .ps or .eps) GIMP requires a powerful free software program called Ghostscript.
Installing Ghostscript
Linux distributions almost always come with Ghostscript already installed (not necessarily the most recent version). For other operating systems you may have to install it yourself. Here are instructions for installing it on Windows
Go to the Ghostscript project page on Sourceforge .
Look for the package gnu-gs or ghostscript (for non-commercial use only) and go to the download section.
Equation for layer mode Multiply
$$E = \frac{M \times I}{255}$$
The mode is commutative; the order of the two layers doesn't matter.
Example for layer mode Divide
Divide mode multiplies each pixel value in the lower layer by 256 and then divides that by the corresponding pixel value of the upper layer plus one. (Adding one to the denominator avoids dividing by zero.) The resulting image is often lighter and sometimes looks burned out.

Running GIMP
Most often you start GIMP either by clicking on an icon (if your system is set up to provide you with one) or by typing gimp on a command line. If you have multiple versions of GIMP installed you may need to type gimp-2.10 to get the latest version. You can if you want give a list of image files on the command line after the program name and they will automatically be opened by GIMP as it starts. It is also possible though to open files from within GIMP once it is running.
Most operating systems support file associations which associates a class of files (as determined by their filename extension such as .jpg) with a corresponding application (such as GIMP). When image files are properly associated to GIMP you can double click on an image to open it in GIMP.
Known Platforms
The GIMP is the most widely supported image manipulation available today. The platforms on which GIMP is known to work include
In multi-window mode you can also click on the dialog title and drag it to the wanted place.
Integrating a new dialog in a dialog group
Here in multi-window mode the Histogram dialog was dragged to the tab bar of the Layers-Undo dock.
More simple the Add tab command in the Tab menu .
Anchoring a dialog to a dock border
Undoing
When you make mistakes you can undo them. Nearly everything you can do to an image is undoable. In fact you can usually undo a substantial number of the most recent things you did if you decide that they were misguided. GIMP makes this possible by keeping a history of your actions. This history consumes memory though so undoability is not infinite. Some actions use very little undo memory so that you can do dozens of them before the earliest ones are deleted from this history; other types of actions require massive amounts of undo memory. You can configure the amount of memory GIMP allows for the undo history of each image but in any situation you should always be able to undo at least your 2-3 most recent actions. (The most important action that is not undoable is closing an image. For this reason GIMP asks you to confirm that you really want to close the image if you have made any changes to it.)
Many probably most of the things that you do to an image in GIMP are done by the GIMP application itself. However GIMP also makes extensive use of plug-ins which are external programs that interact very closely with GIMP and are capable of manipulating images and other GIMP objects in very sophisticated ways. Many important plug-ins are bundled with GIMP but there are also many available by other means. In fact writing plug-ins (and scripts) is the easiest way for people not on the GIMP development team to add new capabilities to GIMP.
All of the commands in the Filters menu and a substantial number of commands in other menus are actually implemented as plug-ins.
In addition to plug-ins which are programs written in the C language GIMP can also make use of scripts. The largest number of existing scripts are written in a language called Script-Fu which is unique to GIMP (for those who care it is a dialect of the Lisp-like language called Scheme). It is also possible to write GIMP scripts in Python or Perl. These languages are more flexible and powerful than Script-Fu; their disadvantage is that they depend on software that does not automatically come packaged with GIMP so they are not guaranteed to work correctly in every GIMP installation.
Layers that belong to a layer group are slightly indented to the right allowing you know easily which layers are part of the group.
If a layer group is made invisible using the eye icon but still open (so that the layers inside the group are shown in the list) there is a struck out eye shown besides the layers that are inside the group to indicate that these layers are not displayed in the final projection of the image but theoretically visible in the layer group.
Raise and Lower Layer Groups
You can raise and lower layer groups in the layer dialog as you do with normal layers click-and-dragging using arrow up and down keys at the bottom of the layer dialog.
Duplicate a Layer Group
A high value for bevel width gives the illusion of a higher button.
If you type TRUE for "Press" the button will look pushed down.
Choose transparency if you don't want a solid background. If you choose a solid background make sure it is the same color as the web page background.
Here you will find all kinds of logo-generating scripts. This is nice but use it with care as people might recognize your logo as being made by a known GIMP script. You should rather regard it as a base that you can modify to fit your needs. The dialog for making a logo is more or less the same for all such scripts
In the Text String field type your logo name like Frozenriver.
Linear  / Logarithmic  buttons
The histogram shown at the top changed to logarithmic mode.
These buttons determine whether the histogram will be displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. For images taken from photographs the linear mode is most commonly useful. For images that contain substantial areas of constant color though a linear histogram will often be dominated by a single bar and a logarithmic histogram will often be more useful.
Range Setting
Dialog aspect after range fixing.
The dialog allows you to set the specifications of the selected template.
You can access this editor by clicking on the Edit Template button at the bottom of the dialog.
In this text box you can modify the displayed template name.
By clicking on this icon you open a list of icons. You can choose one of them to illustrate the selected template name.
Here you set the width and height of the new image. The default units are pixels but you can switch to some other unit if you prefer using the adjoining menu. If you do note that the resulting pixel size will be determined by the X and Y resolution (which you can change in the Advanced Options) and by the setting of Dot for Dot which you can change in the View menu.
Lock pixels When the button is pressed down you cannot use any brush-based tool (Paintbrush Pencil Eraser etc.) the Airbrush or the Ink tool on the currently selected layer. This may be necessary to protect them from unwanted changes.
Lock position and size This toggle button enables and disables protection of layers from moving them around or transforming them. When the button is pressed down you cannot use any transform tool (Rotate Shear Perspective and others) or move it.
Lock alpha channel This toggle button controls the Lock setting for the transparency of the layer . If this is pressed down then the alpha channel for the layer is locked and no manipulation has any effect on it. In particular nothing that you do to a transparent part of the layer will have any effect.
Example for Locking Alpha Channel
The active layer has three horizontal opaque green stripes on a transparent background. We paint a vertical red stripe. Lock unchecked Opaque and transparent areas of the active layer are painted with red.
Sample merged When this option is checked colors are picked from all visible layers. If unchecked pixels are picked from the active layer only even though not visible.
Selected pixels only As the name says pixels are picked from the selected area only in the active layer or all visible layers according to the status of the previous option.
You can give a name to the new palette here. If the name you choose is already used by an existing palette a unique name will be formed by appending a number (e. g. "#1").
Here you specify the number of colors in the palette. The default is 256 chosen for three reasons (1) every gradient contains 256 distinct colors; (2) GIF files can use a maximum of 256 colors; (3) GIMP indexed images can contain a maximum of 256 distinct colors. You can use any number you like here though GIMP will try to create a palette by spacing the specified number of colors even across the color range of the gradient or image.
Here you specify the number of columns for the palette. This only affects the way the palette is displayed and has no effect on the way the palette is used.

Filter Weave applied
The Weave command is a Script-Fu script which creates a new layer filled with a weave effect and adds it to the image as an overlay or bump map. The result of the image looks as if it were printed over woven ribbons of paper thin wooden sheet or stripped bamboo.
If the image is in indexed colors this menu entry is grayed out and unavailable.
This filter adds a Multiply mode layer upon the layer where you activate this command. The weave texture is rendered in gray levels.
This filter is found in the image window menu under FiltersArtisticWeave.
This parameter controls the size of areas the filter works with. Large values result in very thick black areas and much less detail in the resulting image. Small values result in more subtle pen strokes and more details preserved.
This parameter controls the amount of black color added to the image. Small values make the blend from color regions to blackened areas smoother and dark lines themselves thinner and less noticeable. Larger values make the lines thicker darker and sharper. The maximum value makes the lines aliased. The best most natural results are usually achieved with an intermediate value.

The Laplacian edge detection uses the second derivative (fig.3). The top of the curve is now at zero and clearly identified. That's why Laplace filter renders a thin border only a pixel wide. But this derivative gives several zeros corresponding to small ripples resulting in false edges.
Some blurring before applying edge filters is often necessary it flattens small ripples in signal and so prevents false edges.

An alpha channel of a layer is a grayscale image of the same size as the layer representing its transparency. For each pixel the gray level (a value between 0 and 255) represents the pixels's Alpha value. An alpha channel can make areas of the layer to appear partially transparent. That's why the background layer has no alpha channel by default.
The image alpha channel which is displayed in the channels dialog can be considered as the alpha channel of the final layer when all layers have been merged.
Explanation
Antialiasing is the process of reversing an alias that is reducing the jaggies. Antialiasing produces smoother curves by adjusting the boundary between the background and the pixel region that is being antialiased. Generally pixel intensities or opacities are changed so that a smoother transition to the background is achieved. With selections the opacity of the edge of the selection is appropriately reduced.

The GNU project was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman with the goal of developing a completely free operating system. It is especially well-known from the GNU General Public License (GPL) and GNU/Linux a GNU-variant with a Linux kernel.
The name came about from the naming conventions which were in practice at MIT where Stallman worked at the time. For programs which were similar to other programs recursive acronyms were chosen as names. Since the new system was to be based on the widespread operating system Unix Stallman looked for that kind of name and came up with GNU which stands for GNU is not Unix. In order to avoid confusion the name should be pronounced with the G not like new. There were several reasons for making GNU Unix-compatible. For one thing Stallman was convinced that most companies would refuse a completely new operating system if the programs they used wouldn't run on it. In addition the architecture of Unix made quick easy and distributed development possible since Unix consists of many small programs that can be developed independently of each other for the most part. Also many parts of a Unix system were freely available to anyone and could therefore be directly integrated into GNU for example the typesetting system TeX or the X Window System. The missing parts were newly written from the ground up.
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an official GNU application .
Grayscale is a mode for encoding the colors of an image which contains only black white and shades of gray.
When you create a new image you can choose to create it in Grayscale mode (which you can colorize later by changing it to RGB mode). You can also change an existing image to grayscale by using the Grayscale Desaturate Decompose Channel Mixer although not all formats will accept these changes. Although you can create images in Grayscale mode and convert images to it it is not a color model in the true sense of the word.
This method is typically used for business graphics. The relative saturation of colors is mostly maintained but lightning is usually changed.
This rendering intent is most often used in proofing. It preserves the native device white point of the source image.
Additive color model
RGB is a color model which has components for Red Green and Blue. These colors are emitted by screen elements and not reflected as they are with paint. The resulting color is a combination of the three primary RGB colors with different degrees of lightness. If you look closely at your television screen whose pitch is less than that of a computer screen you can see the red green and blue elements lit with different intensities. The RGB color model is additive.
GIMP uses eight bits per channel for each primary color. That means there are 256 intensities (Values) available resulting in 256×256×256 = 16777216 colors.
A new Hue-Chroma filter in the Colors menu works much like Hue-Saturation but operates in CIE LCH color space.
The Fuzzy Select and the Bucket Fill tools can now select colors by their values in CIE L C and H channels.
Both the Color Picker and the Sample Points dialog now display pixel values in CIE LAB and CIE LCH at your preference.

Common options common to shadows and highlights
White point adjustment By default the algorithm of this modules leaves black point and white point untouched. In some cases an image might contain tonal variations beyond the white point i.e. above a luminance value of 100. A negative shift in the white point adjustment slider allows to bring these values down into the proper range so that further details in the highlights get visible.
Radius This slider controls the radius of the involved blurring filter. Higher values give softer transitions between shadows and highlights but might introduce halos. Lower values will reduce the size of halos but may lead to an artificial look.

Example of gradient map
Example of Gradient Mapping. Top Original image. Middle a gradient. Bottom result of applying the gradient to the original image with the Gradient Map filter.
This filter uses the current gradient as shown in the Brush/Pattern/Gradient area of the Toolbox to recolor the active layer or selection of the image to which the filter is applied. To use it first choose a gradient from the Gradients Dialog. Then select the part of the image you want to alter and activate the filter. The filter runs automatically without showing any dialog or requiring any further input.

Close image
The Close command closes the active image.It is disabled if no image is open.
Closing an image is not undoable once it is closed everything is gone including the undo history. If the image is not clean — that is if you have changed it since the last time you saved it — you are asked to confirm that you really want to close it. Note that an image is marked as clean when it is saved to a file even if the file format chosen does not preserve all the information in the image so it is a good idea to think for a moment about what you are doing before closing an image. If there is the slightest possibility that you will regret it save the file (automatically in the XCF file format since GIMP-2.8).

Autocrop Layer
Auto-crop
The Autocrop Layer command automatically crops the active layer unlike the Crop Tool or the Crop Layer command which let you manually define the area to be cropped.
This command removes the largest possible area around the outside edge which all has the same color. It does this by scanning the layer along a horizontal line and a vertical line and cropping the layer as soon as it encounters a different color whatever its transparency.
You can use this command to crop the layer to the dimensions of a subject that is lost in a solid background which is too large.
Non-transparent pixels of the active layer have been subtracted from the existing rectangular selection.
Move current layer one position up
The Raise Layer command raises the active layer one position in the layer stack. If the active layer is already at the top or if there is only one layer this menu entry is insensitive and grayed out. If the active layer is at the bottom of the stack and it does not have an alpha channel it cannot be raised until you add an alpha channel to it.

The Tool Options dialog of the Airbrush tool.
If you have things set up like most people do activating a tool causes its Tool Options dialog to appear below the Toolbox. If you don't have things set up this way you probably should it is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able to manipulate their options.
The Tool Options appear beneath the Toolbox in the default setup. If you lose it somehow you can get it back by creating a new Tool Options dialog using WindowsDockable DialogsTool Options and then docking it below the Toolbox. See the section on Dialogs and Docking if you need help.
Each tool has its own specific set of options. The choices you make for them are kept throughout the session until you change them. In fact the tool options are maintained from session to session. The persistence of tool options across sessions can sometimes be an annoying nuisance a tool behaves very strangely and you can't figure out why until you remember that you were using some unusual option the last time you worked with it two weeks ago.
At the bottom of the Tool Options dialog four buttons appear
Remove a node While pressing ShiftCtrl key combination point to a node. Pointer turns to -. Click to delete the node.
Add a handle to a node Point to a node. Pointer turns to small hand. Drag the node handle appears. Pressing Shift toggles to symmetric handles.
Remove a handle from a node While pressing ShiftCtrl key combination point to a handle. The pointer doesn't turn to the expected - and remains a hand. Click to delete the handle.

and MyPaint brushes a new feature in Gimp-2.10.6
behave like the intuitive notion of painting with a brush. Pencil Paintbrush and Airbrush are called basic painting tools or brushnbsp;tools.

When the source is set and you press this key you will see a thin line connecting the previously clicked point with the current pointer location. If you click again while continuing to hold down the Shift key the tool will clone along this line. Particularly useful when cloning from a pattern.

The Clone tool uses the current brush to copy from an image or pattern. It has many uses one of the most important is to repair problem areas in digital photos by painting over them with pixel data from other areas. This technique takes a while to learn but in the hands of a skilled user it is very powerful. Another important use is to draw patterned lines or curves see Patterns for examples.
If you want to clone from an image instead of a pattern you must tell GIMP which image you want to copy from. You do this by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking in the desired source image. Until you have set the source in this way you will not be able to paint with the Clone tool the tool cursor tells you this by showing .

or by clicking on the N keyboard shortcut.

The GIMP provides 11 shapes which can be selected from the drop-down list. Details on each of the shapes are given below.
Examples of gradient shapes
Bi-Linear
This gradient begins with the foreground color at the starting point of the drawn line and transitions linearly to the background color at the ending point.
This shape proceeds in both directions from the starting point for a distance determined by the length of the drawn line. It is useful for example for giving the appearance of a cylinder.
As with fuzzy tool the selection starts as soon as you click and the reference is the first clicked pixel. If you click and drag you can change the threshold by the same way as with the fuzzy tool.
You can move the selection outline with the arrow keys not with the mouse.
Tool Options for the Select by Color tool
Select transparent areas Sample merged Draw mask
These three options work exactly the same way they were described for the fuzzy selection already. See for  details.
Roughly select the foreground you want to extract. When you select this tool the mouse pointer goes with the lasso icon. It actually works like the Free Select tool. Select as little as possible from the background.
When the mouse pointer comes over line beginning a small yellow circle appears release mouse button to close selection. While selecting click-and-drag draws a fuzzy line drag only draws a straight line.
If the mouse pointer doesn't cover start point double clicking closes selection with a straight line.
The selection is closed.
As soon you click to start drawing a small window pops up  For the moment only a little cross is active allowing to quit returns to the original image.
This menu allows you the option of constraining the shape of the rectangle in different ways.
This option allows you to design and resize the selection while keeping the aspect ratio fixed and written within the relevant box. By default the ratio is 11 (so we have a square) but it can be changed. With the two little landscape and picture icons you can invert this ratio.
With this choice you can fix the width of the selection.
With this choice you can fix the height of the selection.
With this choice you can fix the width and height of the selection.
Also called The Golden Ratio. This divides the transforming area in nine parts using a mathematical formula proportioning the parts to each others and to the area to be transformed.
Divide the transforming area using diagonally lines.
Puts a rectangular grid with equal numbers of vertically and horizontally lines. The number of lines is set in the slider popping up when this guide is selected.
Puts a rectangular grid on the transforming area using the spacing between the lines set in the slider.
Transforming Paths
The Move Mode must be Layer. Then you can choose between Move the Active Layer and if you have one or more layers Point to Layer (or Guide).
Moving Grouped Layers
If layers are grouped (with the little chain symbol) they will all move regardless of which layer is currently active.
Moving a guide
When you pull a guide from a ruler the Move tool is automatically activated. That's not the case after using another tool and you have to activate it by yourself. When the mouse pointer goes over a guide this guide turns to red and you can click-and-drag to move it.

There are many reasons to crop an image; for example fitting an image to fill a frame removing a portion of the background to emphasize the subject etc. There are two methods to activate the crop tool. Click the  button in the Toolbox or use ToolsTransform ToolsCrop in the image window. This changes the cursor and allow you to click and drag a rectangular shape. The button in the toolbox is the easiest way to get to any of the tools.
Select a Region to Crop
Click on one corner of the desired crop area and drag your mouse to create the crop rectangle. You don't have to be accurate as you can change the exact shape of the rectangle later.
Dialog for Cropping
After completing the click and drag motion a rectangle with special regions is shown on the canvas. As the cursor is moved over the different areas of the selected crop area the cursor changes. You can then drag the rectangle's corners or edges to change the dimensions of the selected area. As shown in the figure above as the crop area is resized the dimensions and ratio are shown in the status bar. Double-click inside the rectangle or press Enter to complete cropping. See  for more information on cropping in GIMP.
The .gih ("gimp image hose") format is used for animated brushes. These brushes are constructed from images containing multiple layers each layer may contain multiple brush-shapes arranged in a grid. When you save an image as a .gih file a dialog comes up that allows you to describe the format of the brush. Look at The GIH dialog box for more information about the dialog. The GIH format is rather complicated a complete description can be found in the file gih.txt in the devel-docs directory of the GIMP source distribution.
The .vbr format is used for parametric brushes i. e. brushes created using the Brush Editor. There is really no other meaningful way of obtaining files in this format.
MYB
The .myb format is used for MyPaint brushes. Please refer to  for more information.
To make a brush available place it in one of the folders in GIMP's brush search path. By default the brush search path includes two folders the system brushes folder which you should not use or alter and the brushes folder inside your personal GIMP directory. You can add new folders to the brush search path using the Brush Folders page of the Preferences dialog. Any GBR GIH or VBR file included in a folder in the brush search path will show up in the Brushes dialog the next time you start GIMP or as soon as you press the Refresh button in the Brushes dialog.

Make Sure You Have The Proper Spacing Too
If you are familiar with other programming languages like C/C++ Perl or Java you know that you don't need white space around mathematical operators to properly form an expression
3+5 3 +5 3+ 5
These are all accepted by C/C++ Perl and Java compilers. However the same is not true for Scheme. You must have a space after a mathematical operator (or any other function name or operator) in Scheme for it to be correctly interpreted by the Scheme interpreter.
Practice a bit with simple mathematical equations in the Script-Fu Console until you're totally comfortable with these initial concepts.
We will therefore create a script called Text Box which creates an image correctly sized to fit snugly around a line of text the user inputs. We'll also let the user choose the font font size and text color.
Editing And Storing Your Scripts
Up until now we've been working in the Script-Fu Console. Now however we're going to switch to editing script text files.
Where you place your scripts is a matter of preference mdash; if you have access to GIMP's default script directory you can place your scripts there. However I prefer keeping my personal scripts in my own script directory to keep them separate from the factory-installed scripts.
In the /.config/GIMP/2.10/ directory that GIMP made off of your home directory you should find a directory called scripts. GIMP will automatically look in your /.config/GIMP/2.10/ directory for a scripts directory and add the scripts in this directory to the Script-Fu database. You should place your personal scripts here.
We're going to add code in two places right before we resize the image and at the end of the script (to return the new image the layer and the text).
All we're doing here is setting the buffer based on the height of the text and adding it twice to both the height and width of our new image. (We add it twice to both dimensions because the buffer needs to be added to both sides of the text.)
Now that we have resized the image to allow for a buffer we need to center the text within the image. This is done by moving it to the (x y) coordinates of (theBuffer theBuffer). I added this line after resizing the layer and the image
(gimp-layer-set-offsets theText theBuffer theBuffer)
Go ahead and save your script and try it out after refreshing the database.
From version 2.4 GIMP incorporated a special remove red eye filter. Make a selection with one of the selection tools of the red part of the eye and then choose the Remove Red Eye filter. Perhaps you have to fiddle around a bit with the threshold slider to get the right color.
Saving Your Results
What file format should you use to save the results of your work and should you resize it? The answers depend on what you intend to use the image for.
If you intend to open the image in GIMP again for further work you should save it in GIMP's native XCF format (i. e. name it something.xcf) because this is the only format that guarantees that none of the information in the image is lost.
If you intend to print the image on paper you should avoid shrinking the image except by cropping it. The reason is that printers are capable of achieving much higher resolutions than video monitors mdash; 600 to 1400 dpi (dots per inch the physical density) for typical printers as compared to 72 to 100 pixels per inch for monitors. A 3000nbsp;xnbsp;5000-pixel image looks huge on a monitor but it only comes to about 5 inches by 8 inches on paper at 600 ppi. There is usually no good reason to expand the image either you can't increase the true resolution that way and it can always be scaled up at the time it is printed. As for the file format it will usually be fine to use JPEG at a quality level of 75 to 85. In rare cases where there are large swaths of nearly uniform color you may need to set the quality level even higher or use a lossless format such as TIFF instead.

Creating and Using Selections
In computer science an array has a myarray(xyz) form for a 3 dimensions array (3D). It's easy to imagine a 2D array on a paper it's an array with rows and columns  With a 3d array we don't talk rows and columns but Dimensions and Ranks. The first dimension is along x axis the second dimension along y axis the third along z axis. Each dimension has ranks of cells. 
To fill up this array GIMP starts retrieving cells from the top of stack. The way it fills the array reminds that of an odometer right rank digits turn first and when they reach their maximum left rank digits start running. If you have some memories of Basic programming you will have with an array(422) the following succession (111)(112)(121)(122)(211)(212)(222)(311). (422). We will see this later in an example.
Besides the rank number that you can give to each dimension you can also give them a Selection mode. You have several modes that will be applied when drawing
GIMP selects a rank from the concerned dimension according to the order ranks have in that dimension.
GIMP selects a rank at random from the concerned dimension.
Using the Size slider of the tool options. Pencil Paintbrush Eraser Airbrush Clone Heal Perspective Clone Blur/Sharpen and Dodge/Burn tools have a slider to vary the brush size.

In the left column of the new window select Input DevicesInput Controllers.
Try to use the system monitor profile  If checked GIMP will try to use the display color profile of the system windows handler. Else the configured monitor profile is used.
This option is about how colors are converted from the color space of your image to your display device. Four modes are available Perceptual Relative colorimetric Saturation and  Absolute colorimetric.
Relative colorimetric is usually the best choice (default). Unless you use a LUT monitor profile (most monitor profile are matrix) choosing perceptual intent actually gives you relative colorimetric.
This option is checked by default. Do use black point compensation unless you have a reason not to.
Two options Speed and Precision/Color fidelity. Speed is activated by default. If not image display might be better at the cost of speed.

When set to TRUE keep original message signature in replies otherwise strip the signature and everything below it when replying to the message.
Ignore list Reply-To
Some mailing lists set a Reply-To header to trick users into sending replies to the list even when they ask Evolution to make a private reply. Setting this option to TRUE will attempt to ignore such Reply-To headers so that Evolution will do as you ask it. If you use the private reply action it will reply privately while if you use the “Reply to List” action it will do that. It works by comparing the Reply-To header with a List-Post header if there is one.

Cards in the Tableau are built down in sequence by alternating colours building round the corner. Groups of cards can't be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau must be filled by the top card in Waste or the next card from the Stock. Top cards can be moved to the Foundation or other Tableau piles.
Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card. Empty Foundations must be filled with the base card that is selected by the user from four random cards as the first move. Cards in Foundations are out of play.
Top card of the Reserve is in play and can only be moved to Foundations.
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually as many times as you like unless there is a space in the tableau. If there is a space in the tableau then only one card may be flipped from the stock to the waste until the tableau is filled or the top card of the waste is moved to the foundation or tableau. While the stock is locked you can still move cards around on the tableau from the reserve and to the foundation. If the Waste is empty a card from the Stock is automatically dealt. Top card in Waste is in play. Stock cannot be turned.
Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
Disk Usage Analyzer is a graphical application for analysing storage device usage. It can be used to scan multiple local or remote storage devices including hard disks SSDs USB sticks digital cameras and memory cards. Disk Usage Analyzer can scan either the whole file system your Home directory a specified folder or a remote directory.
The results may be useful in deciding which folders can be archived deleted or moved to free up space. You can also use the results to estimate how much space would be needed for a backup of specific folders.
Display the results as a ring chart or a treemap chart.
Different chart views
By default the scan results show each subfolder as the section of a ring comprising an angle proportional to the size of the relevant folder. Sub-folders are shown in different colors as additional layers around the inner ring.

. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed.
The purpose of this License is to make a manual textbook or other written document free in the sense of freedom to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it with or without modifying it either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The Document below refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee and is addressed as you.
A Secondary Section is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters or of legal commercial philosophical ethical or political position regarding them.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this License and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the Library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions

GDM allows multiple users to be logged in at the same time. After one user is logged in additional users can log in via the User Switcher on the GNOME Panel or from the "Switch User" button in Lock Screen dialog of GNOME Screensaver. The active session can be changed back and forth using the same mechanism. Note that some distributions may not add the User Switcher to the default panel configuration. It can be added using the panel context menu.
Note this feature is available on systems that support Virtual Terminals. This feature will not function if Virtual Terminals is not available.
The GDM User And Group
For security reasons a dedicated user and group id are recommended for proper operation. This user and group are normally "gdm" on most systems but can be configured to any user or group. All GDM GUI programs are run as this user so that the programs which interact with the user are run in a sandbox. This user and group should have limited privilege.
The only special privilege the "gdm" user requires is the ability to read and write Xauth files to the lt;vargt;/run/gdm directory. The lt;vargt;/run/gdm directory should have rootgdm ownership and 1777 permissions.
Debug Options
[debug]
Enable=false
To enable debugging set the debug/Enable key to "true" in the lt;etcgt;/gdm/custom.conf file and restart GDM. Then debug output will be sent to the system log file (lt;vargt;/log/messages or lt;vargt;/adm/messages depending on your Operating System).
Greeter Options
If set then the assistive tools linked to this GConf key will be started with the GDM GUI program. By default this is a screen reader application.
For the screenmagnifierenabled the screenkeyboardenabled and the screenreaderenabled GConf keys the assistive tool which gets launched depends on the desktop files located in the GDM autostart directory as described in the "Autostart Configuration" section of this manual. Any desktop file in the GDM autostart directory can be linked to these GConf key via specifying that GConf key in the AutostartCondition value in the desktop file. So the exact AutostartCondition line in the desktop file could be one of the following
When an accessibility key is true then any program which is linked to that key in a GDM autostart desktop file will be launched (unless the Hidden key is set to true in that desktop file). A single GConf key can even start multiple assistive tools if there are multiple desktop files with this AutostartCondition in the GDM autostart directory.
Example Of Modifying Accessibility Tool Configuration
For example if GNOME is distributed with GOK as the default on-screen keyboard then this could be replaced with a different program if desired. To replace GOK with the on-screen keyboard application "onboard" and additionally activate the assistive tool "mousetweaks" for dwelling support then the following configuration is needed.
Turn on fullscreen mode
To turn on fullscreen mode press F11. gedit's menu title and tab-bars will hide and you will only be presented with the text of your current file.
If you need to perform an action from the gedit menu while working in fullscreen mode move your mouse pointer to the top of the screen. The gedit menu bar will reappear and you can select your desired action.
To switch between open tabs while in fullscreen mode press either CtrlAltPgUp or CtrlAltPgDn.
Turn off fullscreen mode

The following options can be set using gedit modelines

Windows 7 supports a similar scheme to Linux in that profiles can be installed system-wide or specific to the user. They are however stored in the same place. Right click on the profile in Windows Explorer and click Install profile or copy the .icc profile to C\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color.
Open Control CenterColor Management and then add the profile to the system by clicking the Add button. Click on the Advanced tab and look for Display Calibration. Calibration curve loading is enabled by the Use Windows display calibration checkbox but it is not sensitive. This can be enabled by clicking on Change system defaults and then returning to the Advanced tab and then clicking the checkbox.
Close the dialog and click Reload current calibrations to set the gamma ramps. The profile calibration curves should now be set for every boot.

Quickly turn bounce keys on and off
You can turn bounce keys on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Bounce Keys. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the Universal Access panel.
Use the Acceptance delay slider to change how long bounce keys waits before it registers another key press after you pressed the key for the first time. Select Beep when a key is rejected if you want the computer to make a sound each time it ignores a key press because it happened too soon after the previous key press.

You can also turn sticky keys on and off by clicking the accessibility icon on the top bar and selecting Sticky Keys. The accessibility icon is visible when one or more settings have been enabled from the Universal Access panel.
If you press two keys at once you can have sticky keys turn itself off temporarily to let you enter a keyboard shortcut in the normal way.
For example if you have sticky keys turned on but press Super and Tab simultaneously sticky keys would not wait for you to press another key if you had this option turned on. It would wait if you only pressed one key however. This is useful if you are able to press some keyboard shortcuts simultaneously (for example keys that are close together) but not others.
Select Disable if two keys are pressed together to enable this.
You can have the computer make a “beep” sound when you start typing a keyboard shortcut with sticky keys turned on. This is useful if you want to know that sticky keys is expecting a keyboard shortcut to be typed so the next key press will be interpreted as part of a shortcut. Select Beep when a modifier key is pressed to enable this.
If you created your backup using a backup application such as Déjà Dup it is recommended that you use the same application to restore your backup. Review the application help for your backup program it will provide specific instructions on how to restore your files.

Applying curves to its color channels
The idea of calibration is to put a device in a defined state with regard to its color response. Often this is used as a day to day means of maintaining reproducible behavior. Typically calibration will be stored in device or systems specific file formats that record the device settings or per-channel calibration curves.
Characterization (or profiling) is recording the way a device reproduces or responds to color. Typically the result is stored in a device ICC profile. Such a profile does not in itself modify color in any way. It allows a system such as a CMM (Color Management Module) or a color aware application to modify color when combined with another device profile. Only by knowing the characteristics of two devices can a way of transferring color from one device representation to another be achieved.
Note that a characterization (profile) will only be valid for a device if it’s in the same state of calibration as it was when it was characterized.
Generic profiles are usually bad. When a manufacturer creates a new model they just take a few items from the production line and average them together
Averaged profiles
Display panels differ quite a lot from unit to unit and change substantially as the display ages. It is also more difficult for printers as just changing the type or weight of paper can invalidate the characterization state and make the profile inaccurate.
The best way of ensuring the profile you have is accurate is by doing the calibration yourself or by letting an external company supply you with a profile based on your exact characterization state.
Color management is important for designers photographers and artists.
Test your hard disk for problems to make sure that it’s healthy.
Check your hard disk for problems
Checking the hard disk
Hard disks have a built-in health-check tool called SMART (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) which continually checks the disk for potential problems. SMART also warns you if the disk is about to fail helping you avoid loss of important data.
Although SMART runs automatically you can also check your disk’s health by running the Disks application

Set up a VPN connection to a local network over the internet.
Connect to a VPN
A VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a way of connecting to a local network over the internet. For example say you want to connect to the local network at your workplace while you’re on a business trip. You would find an internet connection somewhere (like at a hotel) and then connect to your workplace’s VPN. It would be as if you were directly connected to the network at work but the actual network connection would be through the hotel’s internet connection. VPN connections are usually encrypted to prevent people from accessing the local network you’re connecting to without logging in.
There are a number of different types of VPN. You may have to install some extra software depending on what type of VPN you’re connecting to. Find out the connection details from whoever is in charge of the VPN and see which VPN client you need to use. Then go to the software installer application and search for the NetworkManager package which works with your VPN (if there is one) and install it.
If there isn’t a NetworkManager package for your type of VPN you will probably have to download and install some client software from the company that provides the VPN software. You’ll probably have to follow some different instructions to get that working.

Some device drivers don’t work very well with certain wireless adapters so you may need to find a better one.
Wireless network troubleshooter
Make sure that working device drivers are installed
In this step you can check to see if you can get working device drivers for your wireless adapter. A device driver is a piece of software which tells the computer how to make a hardware device work properly. Even though the wireless adapter has been recognized by the computer it may not have drivers which work very well. You may be able to find different drivers for the wireless adapter which do work. Try some of the options below
Set up automatic suspend
You can configure your computer to automatically suspend when idle. Different intervals can be specified for running on battery or plugged in.
In the Suspend amp; Power Button section click Automatic suspend.
Choose On Battery Power or Plugged In set the switch to on and select a Delay. Both options can be configured.
On a desktop computer there is one option labeled When Idle.
As a last resort turn off the computer by holding in the power button for 5-10 seconds although you will lose any unsaved work by doing this. You should then be able to turn on the computer again.
If this happens every time you suspend your computer the suspend feature may not work with your hardware.
If your computer loses power and does not have an alternative power supply (such as a working battery) it will switch off.
My wireless connection (or other hardware) does not work when I wake up my computer
If you suspend your computer and then resume it again you may find that your internet connection mouse or some other device does not work properly. This could be because the driver for the device does not properly support suspend. This is a problem with the driver and not the device itself.
Be careful that you don’t damage the printer when removing the paper though. If you would have to pull hard on the paper to remove it you should probably just leave it where it is.
Pause and release a print job
If you want to pause or release a print job you can do so by going to the jobs dialog in the printer settings and click the appropriate button.
Click the Show Jobs button on the right-hand side of the Printers dialog and either pause or release the print job based on your needs.
Print a document on a different paper size or orientation.
Screen lock Usage history Purge trash amp; temporary files

Stop or limit your computer from tracking your recently-used files.
Turn off or limit file history tracking
Tracking recently used files and folders makes it easier to find items that you have been working on in the file manager and in file dialogs in applications. You may wish to keep your file usage history private instead or only track your very recent history.
The screen locks itself too quickly
If you leave your computer for a few minutes the screen will automatically lock itself so you have to enter your password to start using it again. This is done for security reasons (so no one can mess with your work if you leave the computer unattended) but it can be annoying if the screen locks itself too quickly.
To wait a longer period before the screen is automatically locked
Press on Screen Lock.
If Automatic Screen Lock is on you can change the value in the Lock screen after blank for drop-down list.

Evolution Data Server
With Evolution Data Server GNOME provides a single address book and calendar that all applications can use to store and retrieve information. Using Evolution Data Server means that users no longer have to maintain separate lists of contacts in each application or manually copy events to their calendar.
People use computers increasingly to interact with their friends and colleagues. Applications such as email programs instant messengers and telephony and video conferencing applications are used to communicate with others. These applications often provide contact lists to help users. Using Evolution Data Server applications can store contact information in a single location allowing all applications to see all the pertinent data about users' contacts.
Applications can also use Evolution Data Server to store and retrieve appointments on the user's calendar. For example the clock on the panel shows a simple calendar when clicked. If the user has any appointments scheduled they are shown alongside the calendar. This makes it easy to see upcoming appointments without opening a full calendar application.

You can only use each combination once i.e. once you've entered something in a slot you can't change the score later if you roll a better hand.
There is one exception to this rule if you roll a yahtzee a second time you can put it in the yahtzee row again for an extra fifty points. You can keep doing this each time you get another yahtzee. At the end of the game you will be given extra rolls to fill in the other rows. Be warned that if you score zero in your yahtzee row (i.e. you filled that row with something that wasn't a yahtzee) then you can't put a yahtzee in afterward zero is all you will score.
There is also a bonus of 35 points if you score a total of 63 points or more in the top six rows.
As an alternative to using the mouse the keys 1 through 5 toggle the dice just as if you had clicked them. The key 1 corresponds to the first die and so on. Use the usual controls to roll the dice and select a row. i.e. use tab to switch between the roll button and the score area use the arrow keys to navigate up and down the rows and use space to select.

The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top" "bottom" "left" "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.
Panel size
The height (width for a vertical panel) of the panel. The panel will determine at runtime a minimum size based on the font size and other indicators. The maximum size is fixed at one quarter of the screen height (or width).
X co-ordinate of panel
The location of the panel along the x-axis. This key is only relevant in un-expanded mode. In expanded mode this key is ignored and the panel is placed at the screen edge specified by the orientation key.

Another advantage is that it is easy to train the model on any writing style simply load up an example file then write away!
Dasher explained -- the library analogy
When someone writes a piece of text their choice of the text string can be viewed as a choice of a book from this library of all books - the book that contains exactly the chosen text. How do they choose that book? Let's imagine they want to write all good things;
The library of all books.
First they walk into the a; section of the library. There they are confronted by books starting aa; ab ac; az; [Picture (ii)]. Looking more closely at the al; section they can find books starting ala; ;alb;; alz; [Picture (iii)].
Some ways of conveying information make use of the timing of gestures. However some people can't make gestures at a required instant. For example spastics find it very difficult to do an action `exactly now!'
If time-critical gestures are not an option go to .
If you can convey information by precisely timed gestures go to section .
`Timeless' choices of Dasher
If so try click mode. Go to .
Add an image to a file
Most audio file formats support an image tag field which can be used to add cover art and other related images to the audio file.
To add an image to the file select the file open the Images tab and press the Add images to the tag button. Select the image and confirm your selection.
Your changes will not be saved automatically.
You can tag multiple files with the same image by selecting them in the list of files then selecting the image and pressing the Tag selected files with these images button. You will need to save these changes to write them to the files.
Ekiga.net is a free SIP services platform provided to Ekiga users. If you want to call other users and to be callable you need a SIP address. You can get one from http//www.ekiga.net. Ekiga.net also offers additional services like conference rooms voice mail or online white pages. Please see http//www.ekiga.net for more information.
Just follow the link given in the dialog to get an account if you do not have one then fill in your username and password. Please press 'Forward' after having entered all required information to continue.
Ekiga can be used with several Internet Telephony Service Providers. Those providers will allow calling real phones from your computer using Ekiga at interesting rates. We recommend you use the default Ekiga provider.
If you want to create an account and use it to call your friends and family using regular phones at interesting rates simply create an account using the "Get an Ekiga Call Out account" link. Once the account has been created you will receive a login and a password by e-mail. Simply enter them in the dialog and you are ready to call regular phones using Ekiga

Managing Codecs
Audio Codecs
The Ekiga audio codecs table in the preferences permits you to change the codec order as well as disabling the codecs you don't want to use. Each codec has strong and weak points. For example G.711 will give the best voice quality but will use the most bandwidth while SPEEX will give an average voice quality but requiring a very low bandwidth usage. Notice that there are two versions of SPEEX; one of them is SPEEX WideBand which has a 16 kHz clock rate.

A terminological note
Keyframes are the points that are used to determine the property value at a specific point in time.
Keyframe curves are the lines connecting the points providing smooth transitions between them.
You can create fade-in and fade-out transitions by controlling opacity and volume. See an example in the Transitions page.
Besides volume and alpha you can use keyframes to control effect properties. See the Using effects page for details.
When zooming in video clips display more thumbnails and audio clips display increasingly detailed waveforms allowing you to do precise edits.
Zooming out allows you to scroll faster along the timeline. Zoom can thus be used in conjunction with scrolling to move quickly between distant points of your project's chronology.
You can zoom in and out by
Holding the Ctrl key while using the mousewheel over the timeline to keep the timeline point where the mouse cursor is in place if possible
Holding the Alt key while using the mousewheel over the timeline to keep the playhead in view
Select the overlapping region by clicking on it.
Select the Transition tab in the middle pane.
Select one of the offered transitions.
The transitions can be further adjusted with the following options from the bottom of the Transition tab
Normal mode will apply the transition in a linear fashion over the whole overlapping region. When in normal mode you can adjust the degree of sharpness/smoothenss of the transition.

Keyboard ShortcutsTired of having to take your hand off the keyboard to use the mouse? Many functions in Gramps have keyboard shortcuts. If one exists for a function it is displayed on the right side of the menu.
Read the ManualDon't forget to read the Gramps manual quot;Help gt; User Manualquot;. The developers have worked hard to make most operations intuitive but the manual is full of information that will make your time spent on genealogy more productive.
Adding ChildrenTo add children in Gramps there are two options. You can find one of their parents in the Families View and open the family. Then choose to create a new person or add an existing person. You can also add children (or siblings) from inside the Family Editor.
Editing the Parent-Child Relationship You can edit the relationship of a child to its parents by double clicking the child in the Family Editor. Relationships can be any of Adopted Birth Foster None Sponsored Stepchild and Unknown.
Show All CheckbuttonWhen adding an existing person as a spouse the list of people shown is filtered to display only people who could realistically fit the role (based on dates in the database). In case Gramps is wrong in making this choice you can override the filter by checking the Show All checkbutton.

A dynamic knowledge base is a list of values of a                          given field. The list is generated dynamically by                          searching the records using a search expression.
Example Your records contain field 270a for                          the name and address of the author's institute.                          If you set the field to '270a' and the expression                          to '270a*Paris*' a list of institutes in Paris                          will be created.
If the expression is empty a list of all values                          in 270a will be created.

This module displays a list of available Content Languages (as defined and published in Language Manager Content tab) for switching between them when one wants to use Joomla! as a multilanguage site. --The plugin 'System - Language Filter' has to be enabled.-- When switching languages and if the menu item displaying the page is not associated to another menu item the module redirects to the Home page defined for the chosen language. Otherwise if the parameter is set for the Language filter plugin it will redirect to the associated menu item in the language chosen. Thereafter the navigation will be the one defined for that language. If the plugin 'System - Language Filter' is disabled this may have unwanted results.Method1. Open Language Manager Content tab and make sure the Languages you want to use in contents are published and have a Language Code for the URL as well as prefix for the image used in the module display.2. Create a Home page by assigning a language to a menu item and defining it as Default Home page for each published content language.   3. Thereafter you can assign a language to any Article Category Module Newsfeed Weblinks in Joomla. 4. Make sure the module is published and the plugin is enabled.  5. When using associated menu items make sure the module is displayed on the pages concerned. 6. The way the flags or names of the languages are displayed is defined by the ordering in the Language Manager - Content Languages.If this module is published it is suggested to publish the administrator multilanguage status module.

Applies a foreground stamp on top of the input PDF document's pages. Pdftk uses only the first page from the stamp PDF and applies it to every page of the input PDF. This page is scaled and rotated as needed to fit the input page. This works best if the stamp PDF page has a transparent background.
PDF-WizardThis wizard uses 'pdftk' and the LaTeX package 'pdfpages' torearrange pages of an existing PDF documentread and update documentinfo of a PDF document (only pdftk)read set or change some permissions of a PDF document (only pdftk). A password is necessary to set or change this document settings. Additionally PDF encryption is done to lock the file's content behind this password.The package 'pdfpages' will only work with non-encrypted documents. 'pdftk' can handle both kind of documents but a password is needed for encrypted files. If one of 'pdftk' or 'pdfpages' is not available the possible rearrangements are reduced.Warning Encryption and a password does not provide any real PDF security. The content is encrypted but the key is known. You should see it more as a polite but firm request to respect the author's wishes.

i18n-rekonq; can be started in the following ways
From the application launcher select  Applications Internet rekonq 
Alt;F2 will open krunner; type rekonq (lower case) and press Enter; to start i18n-rekonq;
i18n-rekonq; main toolbar
By default the i18n-rekonq; window uses only one toolbar. This main toolbar consists of four navigation buttons (Back Forward Reload/Stop) the URL; bar and a menu button Tools. This minimalist approach to the main toolbar marks the most significant user-interface departure from the traditional multi-toolbar paradigm followed by most other browsers like konqueror;.
As you can see using this page you can control Javascript tracking history passwords cookies and cache settings of i18n-rekonq;.
Advanced configuration
Using Proxy pane you can access the system wide proxy server settings. Just press Change them to open the corresponding systemsettings; module.
On the Misc pane you can configure various aspects controlling the browser.
If you enable this option i18n-rekonq; will use smooth scrolling. Uncheck this option if the scrolling becomes choppy.
Title add the document title here.
Date specify the date.
Predefined Templates
The predefined templates in kile; are
Empty document real freaks start from scratch!
\center centers the text.
\verse creates offset text for poems.
\itemize makes an itemized list.
Using kile;
Now that we have given you some background about how to write code using the latex; markup language we will show you how to create a document using kile; step-by-step.
Ctrl;Alt;S F Environment (outside)
Select an environment including the surrounding tags. This selection can also be expanded with a second call of this command.
Ctrl;Alt;S T TeX Group (inside)
Select a tex; group inside the surrounding braces.
Ctrl;Alt;S U TeX Group (outside)
This wizard has already been described in the section .
The Include Graphics dialog makes insertion of graphics as easy as possible. You can reach it via the menubar with LaTeXImage Insertion. Please take a look at  and  to get an overview of some basic facts concerning graphic formats.
Including a graphics element
Choose a graphics file. This can be a JPEG PNG PDF EPS or even a zipped or gzipped EPS file. If you have installed imagemagick; and also configured kile; to use it (SettingsConfigure Kile LaTeXGraphics) the width and the height of the graphic is automatically shown. If imagemagick; can determine a resolution the size of the graphics is also shown in centimeters.
Decide whether your image shall be centered on the page.
pstops choose parameter
There are many options for PostScript; utilities pstops and psselect. If you need a very special one you can invoke pstops with an option of your choice. Please read the manual for all possible options.
psselect choose parameter
You can invoke psselect with an option of your choice. Please read the manual for all possible options.
PDF Utilities
To compile your source code for screen viewers like okular; or further conversion you can use the shortcut Alt;2. Then you can view the DVI; file using your default viewer with Alt;3 convert the DVI; to a PS file with Alt;4 and view the PS file with Alt;5.
bibtex;
If you are using bibtex; for your bibliography entries you usually have to follow a special compiling scheme. This means calling latex; and then bibtex; and then latex; twice again. Fortunately kile; is clever enough to detect automatically if it is necessary to call additional tools like bibtex; makeidx; and asymptote;. This logic is turned on by default and can be changed in SettingsConfigure KileToolsBuild in the General tab in the latex; and pdflatex; tools.
MetaPost and asymptote;
If you want to compile your document with MetaPost or asymptote; picture drawing programs you can do it with BuildCompileMetapost or BuildCompileasymptote;.
Context menu for figure/tables and graphics entries
Updating the Structure View
To update your structure view you can either go to EditRefresh Structure hit F12 or you can save your document which will make kile; update its Structure view.
Bookmarks are your reference to a segment of text or a line inside the kile; environment. To use a bookmark select a specific line of your document you would like to return to then press Ctrl; B and kile; will add a bookmark to this line. Alternatively you can also set a bookmark by highlighting a line and choosing the menu labeled BookmarksSet Bookmark.
To remove all your bookmarks select Bookmarks Clear All Bookmarks.
Pressing the Add button will open another dialog where you can edit the name of the menu entry and choose the corresponding file or URL;. The second button to the right of the text field launches konqueror; which can be used to determine the correct URL;.
Dialog add a new helpentry
After finishing the configuration all the entries will appear in the Help menu of kile; as a special menu entry User help.
Userhelp menu

void document.insertSection();
Insert a \section command. As with choosing the menu entry LaTeXSectioningsection a dialog will appear where you can choose the title and an optional label for this sectioning command.
Dialog insert chapter command
The return value res is an object (better a map) with three properties
statusnbsp; Gives the status code of the operation which can be 0 (no error) 1 (access failed) or 2 (access denied). So if no error occurred the value of res.status or res["status"] will be 0.
resultnbsp; Contains the text of the given file.
messagenbsp; Contains an error message if an error occurred.
Object kile.file.read();
Here is a screenshot of the settings dialog
In the settings dialog you will find four check boxes and two groups of radio buttons.

kdeinit4 --help  --no-fork --no-kded --suicide   +programs programs 
kdeinit4 is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used for booting UNIX. It executes kde; programs and kdeinit loadable modules (KLMs) starting them more efficiently.
Using kdeinit4 to launch kde; applications makes starting a typical kde; application a couple times faster and reduces memory consumption by a substantial amount.
kdeinit4 is linked against all libraries a standard kde; application needs. With this technique starting an application becomes much faster because now only the application itself needs to be linked whereas otherwise both the application as well as all the libaries it uses need to be linked.
The process name of applications started via kdeinit4 is "kdeinit4". This problem can be corrected to a degree by changing the application name as shown by ps. However applications like killall will only see kdeinit4 as the process name. To workaround this use kdekillall (from kdesdk/scripts) for applications started via kdeinit4.

Rotator Angle Control
Position Angle (PA) is defined as degrees E of N. Zero degrees indicate frame UP points directly toward the celestial pole. 90 degrees indicate frame UP points 90 degrees counter-clockwise with respect to the celestial pole.PA is calculated from raw rotator angle plus modifiers to match the rotation angle as measured by astrometry. Enter the modifiers manually or solve an image in the Align Module to generate them automatically.
Position Angle Control

"A sliding-block puzzle game" activity
KStars is freely licensed open source cross-platform Astronomy Software by KDE.
It provides an accurate graphical simulation of the night sky from any location on Earth at any date and time. The display includes up to 100 million stars 13000 deep-sky objectsall 8 planets the Sun and Moon and thousands of comets asteroids supernovae and satellites.
For students and teachers it supports adjustable simulation speeds in order to view phenomena that happen over long timescales the KStars Astrocalculator to predict conjunctions and many common astronomical calculations.
For the amateur astronomer it provides an observation planner a sky calendar tool and an FOV editor to calculate field of view of equipment and display them. Find out interesting objects in the "What's up Tonight" tool plot altitude vs. time graphs for any object print high-quality sky charts and gain access to lots of information and resources to help you explore the universe!

Overall rigidity of the seams
Use this value to give a negative bias to the seams which are not straight. May be useful to prevent distortions in some situations or to avoid artifacts from pixel skipping (it is better to use low values in such case). This setting applies to the whole selected layer if no rigidity mask is used. Note the bias is proportional to the difference in the transversal coordinate between each two successive points elevated to the power of 1.5 and summed up for the whole seam.

Turn off this option to not update file timestamps when files are changed as when you update metadata or image data. Note disabling this option can introduce some dysfunctions with applications which use file timestamps properties to detect file modifications automatically.
Rescan file when files are modified
Turning this option on will force digiKam to rescan files that has been modified outside digiKam. If a file has changed it is file size or if the last modified timestamp has changed a rescan of that file will be performed when digiKam starts.
Clean up the metadata from the database when rescan files
Turning this option on will force digiKam to delete the file metadata contained in the database before the file is rescanned. WARNING if your metadata has been written to the database only and not to the file or sidecar you will be able to lose inserted metadata such as tags keywords or geographic coordinates.

Dark JavaScript v1.3.0
This theme uses JavaScript heavily to provide smooth photo gallery. Naturally images can be navigated without JavaScript support similarly as with the dark theme. The main window provides a thumbnail view with smallest image (by default) on right. The largest generated images can be viewed either with manual navigation or slide show. This theme works best with rather small images that can fully fit to the screen.
Dark v1.0.1
This theme uses darkish colors and provides basic gallery quite similar to other themes in KPhotoAlbum. Possibility to navigate images with keyboard is added if JavaScript support is enabled.

Some tablet devices don't pass barrel-button clicks via tablet API. If you have such a device you can try activate this workaround. Krita will try to read right- and middle-button clicks from the mouse events stream. It may or may not work on your device (depends on the tablet driver implementation).After changing this option Krita should be restarted.
Use mouse events for right- and middle-clicks (workaround for convertible devices needs restart)

The spatula is a laboratory tool to scrape off grind and transport chemicals. The material they are made of (e.g. iron titanium platinum) and their design (e.g. flat spatula or spoon spatula) varies.
Water Jet Pump
The water jet pump has two entry pipes and one exit and consists in principle of two pipes one inside the other. At the water entry a water jet shoots under full pressure out of a nozzle into a slightly larger pipe. The water jet thereby carries away air or fluid from the second entry.  This is caused by the negative pressure in a drifting fluid and thus it is an application of the hydrodynamic paradox (objects close to drifting fluids are aspirated instead of being pushed away).
Refractometer
With a refractometer the refractive index of optical media is determined. If the refractive index of a chemical is known it can be used after a synthesis to determine the sample's purity or to audit the synthesis' success.

The easiest way to handle most of the enemies is to lure them along until they fall into a pit.  But beware the pits fill with ladders once you have all the gold allowing the trapped enemies to escape.
Thrain
Mostly straightforward but beware of a couple of one-way gates in particular in the section at the top right of center.  Be sure to clear out all the gold before freeing the trapped enemy at top right who has a piece of gold.  You will also need to use the false floor on the far right at the top.

The main button at the bottom echoes the menu action you selected. Click it after choosing a game and level - or use "Cancel".
You can select System levels for editing (or copying) but you must save the result in a game you have created.  Use the left mouse-button as a paintbrush and the editor toolbar buttons as a palette.  Use the 'Erase' button or the right mouse-button to erase.  You can drag the mouse with a button held down and paint or erase multiple squares.
You can add a name and hint to your new level here but you must save the level you have created into one of your own games. By default your new level will go at the end of your game but you can also select a level number and save into the middle of your game.

KReversi is a simple one player strategy game played against the computer. If a player's piece is captured by an opposing player that piece is turned over to reveal the color of that player. A winner is declared when one player has more pieces of his own color on the board and there are no more possible moves.
KSame is a game mode of the game Klickety which is an adaptation of the "clickomania" game
KSame is a simple yet challenging color matching game modeled after once famous game of SameGame. The idea behind KSame is to completely clear the game board filled with the multicolored marbles.
KShisen
KShisen is a solitaire-like game played using the standard set of Mahjong tiles. Unlike Mahjong however KShisen has only one layer of scrambled tiles.

Install the cdrdao package.
It is highly recommended to configure cdrdao to run with root privileges to increase the overall stability of the burning process.
Cdrskin can substitute for cdrecord with data and audio CD and for growisofs with DVD and BD.
Consider to install the libburn and cdrskin packages.
K3b uses growisofs to actually write DVDs. Without growisofs you will not be able to write DVDs. Make sure to install at least version 5.10.

Why does K3b offer 4.4 GB and 8.0 GB instead of 4.7 and 8.5 like it says on the media?A single layer DVD media has a capacity of approximately 4.4 GB which equals 4.4*10243 bytes. Media producers just calculate with 1000 instead of 1024 for advertising reasons.This results in 4.4*10243/10003 = 4.7 GB.

Force Dump
Force DumpThis forces a dump for a Callgrind profile run in the current directory. This action is checked while KCachegrind looks for the dump. If the dump is finished it automatically reloads the current trace. If this is the one from the running Callgrind the new created trace part will be loaded too.Force dump creates a file 'callgrind.cmd' and checks every second for its existence. A running Callgrind will detect this file dump a trace part and delete 'callgrind.cmd'. The deletion is detected by KCachegrind and it does a Reload. If there is no Callgrind running press 'Force Dump' again to cancel the dump request. This deletes 'callgrind.cmd' itself and stops polling for a new dump.Note A Callgrind run only detects existence of 'callgrind.cmd' when actively running a few milliseconds i.e. not sleeping. Tip For a profiled GUI program you can awake Callgrind e.g. by resizing a window of the program.

Trace Part ListThis list shows all trace parts of the loaded trace. For each part the self/inclusive cost of the current selected function spent in the part is shown; percentage costs are always relative to the total cost of the part (not to the whole trace as in the Trace Part Overview). Also shown are the calls happening to/from the current function inside of the trace part.By choosing one or more trace parts from the list the costs shown all over KCachegrind will only be the ones spent in the selected part(s). If no list selection is shown in fact all trace parts are selected implicitly.This is a multi-selection list. You can select ranges by dragging the mouse or use SHIFT/CTRL modifiers. Selection/Deselection of trace parts can also be done by using the Trace Part Overview Dockable. This one also supports multiple selection.Note that the list is hidden if only one trace part is loaded.
Annotated SourceThe annotated source list shows the source lines of the current selected function together with (self) cost spent while executing the code of this source line. If there was a call in a source line lines with details on the call happening are inserted into the source the cost spent inside of the call the number of calls happening and the call destination.Select a inserted call information line to make the destination function current.
There is no cost of current selected type associated
with any source line of this function in file
Thus no annotated source can be shown.

Controls whether all activities during thread creation should be ignored. By default enabled only on Solaris. Solaris provides higher throughput parallelism and scalability than other operating systems at the cost of more fine-grained locking activity. This means for example that when a thread is created under glibc just one big lock is used for all thread setup. Solaris libc uses several fine-grained locks and the creator thread resumes its activities as soon as possible leaving for example stack and TLS setup sequence to the created thread. This situation confuses Helgrind as it assumes there is some false ordering in place between creator and created thread; and therefore many types of race conditions in the application would not be reported. To prevent such false ordering this command line option is set to yes by default on Solaris. All activity (loads stores client requests) is therefore ignored during* pthreadcreate() call in the creator thread* thread creation phase (stack and TLS setup) in the created threadAlso new memory allocated during thread creation is untracked that is race reporting is suppressed there. DRD does the same thing implicitly. This is necessary because Solaris libc caches many objects and reuses them for different threads and that confuses Helgrind.
When enabled (not the default) Helgrind treats freeing of heap memory as if the memory was written immediately before the free. This exposes races where memory is referenced by one thread and freed by another but there is no observable synchronization event to ensure that the reference happens before the free.This functionality is new in Valgrind 3.7.0 and is regarded as experimental. It is not enabled by default because its interaction with custom memory allocators is not well understood at present. User feedback is welcomed.

Power analysis
Perform power analysis for a variety of statistical methods.
Given three of the parameters 'power of test' 'sample size' 'effect size' and 'significance level' this plugin will estimate the fourth i.e. for example the test power of a t.test at a given sample size effect size and level of significance. On the left hand specify the statistical method on the right hand side enter the values of the given parameters. In the control in the middle select which of the parameters to estimate.   Note that in some cases it will not be possible to estimate a (finite) parameter at the given specifications. In general this means that you have to increase sample size(s) or effect size or decrease effect power or parameter count.

When calculating densities or probabilities specify one or more quantiles. If this setting is left empty a sequence of evenly spaced quantiles will be used instead.
When calculating quantiles specify one or more probabilities optionally logarithmic (see below). If this setting is left empty a sequence of evenly spaced (log) probabilities will be used instead.
When calculating probabilities return these as log (p). When specifying probabilities these are supplied as log (p).
When calculating densities return these as log (d).

yvar The variable to be used for the y-coordinates.
defaultpointtype A string that provides the default point type when the user chooses 'Default' for ''. The possibilities are plbohs and S; the options for the type argument.
defaultpointcolor A string that provides the default point color when the user chooses 'Default' for ''. For various possibilities see the code colorchooser.xml; the options for the col argument.
defaultmain A string specifying the main argument to plot.default. By default this is "" which means that the main title generated by the plotting function is used. Note The default is always used unquoted. If you want to specify a literal string add quotes explicitly as "quote;".
defaultsub Similar to main above but for the subtitle argument sub.
The filename to save to. By default the file will be saved in the directory from where RkWard was started which is the user's home directory when started from K-menu. After checking for a proper file extension this is the file parameter to dev.print. For exporting via ghostscript provide a suitable extension.
Check this box to let RKWard detect the file extension automatically. If the filename specified in the 'File name' box already has a relevant extension then nothing is done that is the specified filename is used. Otherwise a relevant extension is appended to the filename above to construct the full filename. This option is disabled for exporting via ghostscript.
Choose whether to use postscript pdf svg png or jpeg for exporting the file. This is the device parameter to dev.print. If 'via Ghostscript' is chosen then the output format of the ghostscript device will need to be provided (see below under 'Ghostscript specific options').
When exporting in postscript format this allows you to select whether an EPSF (.eps-file) header should be generated. This seems to generate more portable files so is recommended in most cases. Papersize and orientation can not be set in this case. This sets the onefile parameter to postscript to FALSE.
Check this box to let the export function determine the width automatically.

At the lower right of the dialog there is a button labelled "Code". Using this you can show/hide a text area. If you look at the contents of this text area (you may have to resize the window to view it more comfortably) you can see the text changing according to the settings you choose in the dialog. This text is actually R syntax. It is the code that is needed to perform these calculations in R. Most of RKWard is based on generating this code for you and then running it inside R. Later when you feel more comfortable have specific needs not covered by RKWard or you want to automate repetitive tasks you can use this syntax to literally program your analyses. Note that the code is divided into up to three sections "Preprocess" for loading required libraries or defining helper functions "Calculate" to perform the actual calculations and "Printout" to generate output in RKWard's output window.
For now just click submit once you've made your choices and watch the results show up in a new window.
So much more
The purpose of RKWard is to make the power of the R language easily accessible to the user without having to learn a full programming language first. However for advanced needs you may want to make use of the full flexibility of the R language. RKWard offers a lot of tools to make this easier both for users new to R and R experts. Read on in  for more on this.
Also you may want to select Help->Help on R from the menu for some starting points in learning R.
RKWard is running since ages. Has it hung up?
RKWard seems to hang
This depends. Some test and plots just need some time if you have huge amounts of data or sophisticated calculations. Therefore patience is sometimes needed. In any case you can check the state of R within RKWard. Just look at the little box on the right bottom corner of RKWard. Red means there is still something to calculate or plot. If it's green R is done calculating.
But some statistical test are rather memory and stack hungry and can make the entire system unresponsive if there is a lot of swapping. This is not a bug in RKWard or R just the calculation taking your system to its limits. An example of very memory hungry tests are the Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Signed Rank Tests.
Therefore it's important you know the test. Moreover it's very important to save the workspace and other sections you worked on before you do such operations. There is currently no recovery functionality within RKWard in case of a crash! You can find build-in tests from R to address this memory issue (see  and ).
Whether to draw a mark indicating the mean.
Trim applies only to the arithmetic mean. By default trim is set to zero. It defines the fraction of observations to be trimmed from each end of a variable before the arithmetic mean is computed.
If the mean is to be indicated Symbol to use as mark.
Use this option to select a specific type of mean. The arithmetic mean is the default. Others include the geometric mean the harmonic mean and interquartile mean (IQM).
Whether to draw a mark indicating the standard deviation.
Options concerning the calculation and look of the histogram. Refer to  for details.
Should a density curve be plotted over the histogram? This option is only available if the histogram is density scaled.
Which color should the density line be drawn in?
The smoothing bandwidth used to calculate the density estimate. See  for details.
Remove missing values? If not checked missing values will cause an error.

How do you ensure reliability?
All editors also have the possibility of assembling their own books specifying a precise revision of the content which they want to download. This gives everyone the possibility to assemble their own books even if they don't have the reviewer privileges on our platform.
What about different ways of explaining the same topic?
We support and encourage multiple courses for one same topic! We realize it is a fundamental and enriching practice to see a topic from many different point of views and it is a behavior we want to encourage. This is why we don't have a single reference course for a topic but anyone is free to create their own explaining it from whichever angle they prefer.

How much memory does my image take?
For simple images its easy to calculate you multiply width \* height \* channels \* size of the channels (so for a 1000×1000 16 bit integer rgba image 1000 x 1000 x 4 x 2). You multiply this by the number of layers plus two (one for the image one for the display). If you add masks filter layers or clone layers it gets more complicated.

List Table
Done as follows
Full grid tables are best for when you need all features like complex column and row spans but they're tricky to make. For that reason small tables are best off being done with the simple syntax while really long tables are best done with a list directive because that is just much easier to write and maintain.
Admonishments and asides
Admonishments are sort of like a separate section that the reader needs to pay attention to.
Login to `KDEgitlab`.

Advices for supporters
If you don't understand the question ask for clarification -- asking for a screen recording or a screenshot is perfectly fine.
If you don't know the solution but you know what information will be needed to investigate the issue further don't hesitate to ask. Other supporters may know the answer but have too little time to move the user through the whole process so you're helping a lot just by asking for additional information. This is very much true in case of tablet issues for example.
If you don't know the answer/solution and the question looks abandoned by other supporters you can always ask for help on Krita IRC channel. It's #krita on freenote.net ref`thekritacommunity`.
The teacher gives them a painting assignment They need to paint a red triangle a blue square a green circle and put a yellow border around the three. The kids are very experienced with painting already so the teacher can confidently leave the smarter ones to their own devices and spent more time on those who need help.
The following results come from painting
Even though all groups had the same assignment each group's result looks different.
Group 1 had vermillion red citron yellow and ultramarine blue to their disposal. This means their triangle looks nice and red but their circle's green is muddy. This is because ultramarine is too dark of a blue to create nice greens with.
Group 2 had magenta red citron yellow and cerulean blue. Magenta is a type of red that is closer to pink opposed to vermillion which is closer to orange. However their green looks nice because cerulean is a much lighter blue.
Workingspace
sRGB (the default screen profile) or any larger profile if you can spare the bit depth and like working in them.
sRGB ICC version 2 sRGB TRC for the internet and a specialized CMYK profile from the printing house for the printed images.
Use the sRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc for going between Inkscape Photoshop Painttool Sai Illustrator Gimp Manga Studio Paintstorm Studio MyPaint Artrage Scribus etc. and Krita.
If you are using a larger space via ICC you will only be able to interchange it between Krita Photoshop Illustrator Gimp 2.9 Manga Studio and Scribus. All others assume sRGB for your space no matter what because they don't have color management.
Similar to lightness and Intensity except it weights the red green and blue components based real-life measurements of how much light a color reflects to determine its lightness. Ranges from 0 to 100. Luma is well known for being used in film-color spaces.
This color space only registers gray values. This is useful because by only registering gray values it only needs one channel of information which in turn means the image becomes much lighter in memory consumption!
This is useful for textures but also anything else that needs to stay grayscale like Black and White comics.
Cyan Magenta Yellow Key
This is the color space of printers. Unlike computers printers have these four colors and adding them all adds up to black instead of white. This is thus also called a 'subtractive' color space.
the colors a device can output
Choosing the right workspace profile to use depends on how much colors you need and on the bit depth you plan to use. Imagine a line with the whole color spectrum from pure black (000) to pure blue (001) in a pure XYZ color cube. If you divide it choosing steps at a regular interval you get what is called a linear profile with a gamma=1 curve represented as a straight line from 0 to 1. With 8bit/channel bit depth we have only 256 values to store this whole line. If we use a linear profile as described above to define those color values we will miss some important visible color change steps and have a big number of values looking the same (leading to posterization effect).
This is why was created the sRGB profile to fit more different colors in this limited amount of values in a perceptually regular grading by applying a custom gamma curve (see picture here https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) to emulate the standard response curve of old CRT screens. So sRGB profile is optimized to fit all colors that most common screen can reproduce in those 256 values per R/G/B channels. Some other profiles like Adobe RGB are optimized to fit more printable colors in this limited range primarily extending cyan-green hues. Working with such profile can be useful to improve print results but is dangerous if not used with a properly profiled and/or calibrated good display. Most common CMYK workspace profile can usually fit all their colors within 8bit/channel depth but they are all so different and specific that it's usually better to work with a regular RGB workspace first and then convert the output to the appropriate CMYK profile.
Starting with 16bit/channel we already have 65536 values instead of 256 so we can use workspace profiles with higher gamut range like Wide-gamut RGB or Pro-photo RGB or even unlimited gamut like scRGB.
But sRGB being a generic profile (even more as it comes from old CRT specifications) there are big chances that your monitor have actually a different color response curve and so color profile. So when you are using sRGB workspace and have a proper screen profile loaded (see next point) Krita knows that the colors the file contains are within the sRGB color space and converts those sRGB values to corresponding color values from your monitor profile to display the canvas.
So we have our typical value based workflow where we only paint the grays of the image so that we can focus on the values of the image. We can do something similar with Scene Linear Painting.
Where with the value based workflow you paint the image as if it were a grayscale of what you intended to paint with a lighting based workflow you paint as if all the objects are white. The effect of the color of an object can be determined by multiplying its base color with the color of the light. So you could paint objects as if they were white paint the colors on a separate layer and just use the Multiply blending mode to get the right colors.
.. image images/colorcategory/Kritascenelinearcat02.png
The leftmost image is both the lighting based one and the color layer separate the middle with the two layers multiplied and the right a luminosity based view. This cat is a nice example as it demonstrates why having textures and lighting separate could be interesting.
You can even combine this with a value based workflow by opening a new view and setting the component to luminosity. That way you can see both the grayscale as well as the lighting based version of the image next to one another.
\*.gif
``.gif`` is a file format mostly known for the fact that it can save animations. It's a fairly old format and it does its compression by ref`indexing ` the colors to a maximum of 256 colors per frame. Because we can technically design an image for 256 colors and are always able save over an edited GIF without any kind of extra degradation this is a ref`lossless ` compression technique.
This means that it can handle most grayscale images just fine and without losing any visible quality. But for color images that don't animate it might be better to use ref`filejpg` or ref`filepng`.

Tagged Image File Format
\*.tiff
``.tiff`` or Tagged Image File Format is a raster interchange format that was originally designed to be a common format generated by scanners and used by printers.
It can support multiple color spaces and even layers. However the latter is a bit odd as the official specs owned by Adobe have a different way of saving layers to TIFF than Photoshop also owned by Adobe.

Grain Extract/Grain Merge
A variation on Divide sometimes called 'Color Burn' in some programs.
This inverts the bottom layer then divides it by the top layer and inverts the result. This results in a darkened effect that takes the colors of the lower layer into account similar to the burn technique used in traditional darkroom photography.

Soft Light (IFS Illusions)  Soft Light (Pegtop-Delphi)
These are alternative versions of standard softlight modes which are made to solve discontinuities seen with the standard blend modes. Sometimes these modes offer subtle advantages by offering more contrast within some areas and these advantages are more or less noticeable within different color spaces and depth.

Larger values basically give you larger brushes and larger bristle spacing. For example a value of 4 will multiply your base brush size by 4 but the bristles will be 4 times more spaced apart.
Use smaller values if you want a "dense" brush i.e. you don't want to see so many bristles within the center.
Negative values have the same effect as corresponding positive values -1.00 will look like 1.00 etc.
Adds a jaggy look to the trailing lines.
At 0.00 all the bristles basically remain completely parallel.
.. image images/brushes/Krita-tutorial5-I.2.png
Common behaviors
Unchecking the smudge rate function sets smudge rate to 1.00 (not 0.00).
Opacity Below 0.50 there is practically no smudging left keep opacity over 0.50.
Differences
Painting thick oil style
Many of the included color smudge brush presets produce a thick oil paint-like effect. This is mainly achieved with the Smearing mode on. Basically
Both at 0.50 are fine for normal round brushes or fully opaque predefined brushes
Smearing mode with high smudge and color rates
Up to 1.00 each for brushes with less density or non fully-opaque predefined brushes

The Clones Array functionality in Krita
The idea is that sometimes what you want to animate can be expressed as a value. This allows the computer to do maths on the values and automate tasks like interpolation also known as 'Tweening'. Because these are values like percentage opacity and animation happens over time that means we can visualize the way the values are interpolated as a curve graph and also edit the graph that way.
But when you first open this docker there's no curves visible! You will first need to add opacity keyframes to the active animation layer. You can do this by using the animation docker and selection guilabel`Add new keyframe`.
.. image images/dockers/Animationcurves1.png
Opacity should create a bright red curve line in the docker. On the left in the layer list you will see that the active layer has an outline of its properties A red guilabel`Opacity` has appeared. Pressing the red dot will hide the current curve which'll be more useful in the future when more properties can be animated.
.. image images/dockers/Animationcurves2.png
.. image images/dockers/KritaChannelsDocker.png
The channel docker allows you to turn on and off the channels associated with the color space that you are using. Each channel has an enabled and disabled checkbox. You cannot edit individual layer channels from this docker.
Editing Channels
If you want to edit individual channels by their grayscale component you will need to manually separate a layer. This can be done with a series of commands with the layer docker.
Select the layer you want to break apart.

The grid's base size is 64 pixels. With a subdivision of 2 the main grid lines are 128 px away from one another and the intermediate lines have a different look.
Guides are horizontal and vertical reference lines. You can use them to place and align layers accurately on the canvas.
.. image images/dockers/Guides.jpg
Creating Guides
Some system locals don't allow you to read the configuration files. This is due to a bug in OCIO. If you are using Linux you can fix this. If you start Krita from the terminal with the ``LCALL=C krita`` flag set you should be able to read the configuration files.
Input Color Space
What the color space of the image is. Usually sRGB or Linear.
The type of device you are using to view the colors. Typically sRGB for computer screens.
Allows you to study a single channel of your image with LUT.
For snapping to other vector nodes.
Extensions of Line
For snapping to a point that could have been part of a line had it been extended.
For snapping to the bounding box of a vector shape.
For snapping to only horizontal or vertical lines.
Reusable Vector Shapes
The Vector Library Docker loads the symbol libraries in SVG files when those SVG files are put into the "symbols" folder in the resource folder menuselection`Settings --> Manage Resources --> Open Resource Folder`.
The vector symbols can then be dragged and dropped onto the canvas allowing you to quickly use complicated images.
Currently you cannot make symbol libraries with Krita yet but you can make them by hand as well as use Inkscape to make them. Thankfully there's quite a few svg symbol libraries out there already!
.. image images/Mingw-crash-log-start.png
The angle of the dot pattern.
This inverts the intensity calculated per dot. Thus dark colors will give tiny dots and light colors big dots. This is useful in combination with inverting the colors and give a better pattern on glowy-effects.
This makes the dots smooth which is good for webgraphics. Sometimes for print graphics we want there to be no grays so we turn off the anti-aliasing.
Index Color
The index color filter maps specific user selected colors to the grayscale value of the artwork. You can see the example below the strip below the black and white gradient has index color applied to it so that the black and white gradient gets the color selected to different values.
Wavelet decompose uses wavelet scales to turn the current layer into a set of layers with each holding a different type of pattern that is visible within the image. This is used in texture and pattern making to remove unwanted noise quickly from a texture.
You can find it under menuselection`Layers`.
When you select it it will ask for the amount of wavelet scales. More scales more different layers. Press guilabel`OK` and it will generate a group layer containing the layers with their proper blending modes
Adjust a given layer with middle gray to neutralize it and merge everything with the guilabel`Grain Merge` blending mode to merge it into the end image properly.

Dry Painting
The Dry Painting category is full set of brushes that appear like bristles. They do not interact with the color already on the canvas; that's why they are called "dry". They work as if you were painting on a dry artwork the color replace or overlay/glaze over the previous painting stroke. This brush emulates techniques that dry quickly as tempera or acrylics.

How to use group layers in Krita.
Group Layers
While working in complex artwork you'll often find the need to group the layers or some portions and elements of the artwork in one unit. Group layers come in handy for this they allow you to make a segregate the layers so you can hide these quickly or so you can apply a mask to all the layers inside this group as if they are one you can also recursively transform the content of the group Just drag the mask so it moves to the layer. They are quickly made with the kbd`Ctrl + G` shortcut.
A thing to note is that the layers inside a group layer are considered separately when the layer gets composited the layers inside a group are separately composited and then this image is taken in to account when compositing the whole image while on the contrary the groups in Photoshop have something called pass-through mode which makes the layer behave as if they are not in a group and get composited along with other layers of the stack. The recent versions of Krita have pass-through mode you can enable it to get similar behavior
How to use layer styles in Krita.
The stroke properties dock will allow you to edit a different aspect of how the outline of your vector shape looks.
.. image images/vector/Strokeprops.png
The style selector allows you to choose different patterns and line styles. The width option changes the thickness of the outline on your vector shape. The cap option changes how line endings appear. The join option changes how corners appear.
The Miter limit controls how harsh the corners of your object will display. The higher the number the more the corners will be allowed to stretch out past the points. Lower numbers will restrict the stroke to shorter and less sharp corners.

Determines whether or not the dockers are visible.  This is a nice aid to cleaning up the interface and removing unnecessary "eye-ball clutter" when you are painting.  If you've got your brush and you know you're just going to be painting for awhile why not flip the dockers off?  You'd be amazed what a difference it makes while you're working.  However if you know you're swapping out tools or working with layer or any of the other myriad things Krita lets you do then there's no point getting caught up in flipping the docks on and off.  Use you time wisely!
This is a great candidate to add to the toolbar so you can just click the dockers on and off and don't even have to open the menu to do it. See ref`configuretoolbars` below for more.
Krita subdivides the access of many of its features into functional panels called Dockers. Dockers are small windows that can contain for example things like the Layer Stack Color Palette or Brush Presets. Think of them as the painter's palette or his water or his brushkit.
Learning to use dockers effectively is a key concept to optimizing your time using Krita.
Krita provides a number of color-themed interfaces or "looks".  The current set of themes are the following
Inverse function of the tangent gives you the angle which the tangent equals the argument. Usage ``atan(1.19)`` Output ``50``
Arc Tangent (Operator atan() )
Gives you the value without negatives. Usage ``abs(75-100)`` Output ``25``
Absolute (Operator abs() )
Gives you given values using e as the exponent. Usage ``exp(1)`` Output ``2.7183``

A feature for advanced computer users. This allows program`Krita` to organize the area it takes up on the virtual working desk before putting its data on there. Like how a painter has a standard spot for their canvas program`Krita` also benefits from giving certain data it uses its place (a memory pool) so that it can find them easily and it doesn't get lost among the other data (memory fragmentation). It will then also not have to spend time finding a spot for this data.
Increasing this of course means there's more space for this type of data but like how filling up your working desk with only one big canvas will make it difficult to find room for your paints and brushes having a large internal pool will result in program`Krita` not knowing where to put the other non-specific data.
On the opposite end not giving your canvas a spot at all will result in you spending more time looking for a place where you will put the new layer or that reference you just took out of the storage. This happens for program`Krita` as well making it slower.
This is recommended to be a size of one layer of your image e.g. if you usually paint on the image of 3000x3000x8bit-ARGB the pool should be something like 36 MiB.
As program`Krita` does this on start-up you will need to restart program`Krita` to have this change affect anything.
For rendering to an animated file format Krita will first render to a png sequence and then use FFmpeg which is really good at encoding into video files to render that sequence to an animated file format. The reason for this two-step process is that animation files can be really complex and really big and this is the best way to allow you to keep control over the export process. For example if your computer has a hiccup and one frame saves out weird first saving the image sequence allows you to only resave that one weird frame before rendering.
This means that you will need to find a good place to stick your frames before you can start rendering. If you only do throwaway animations you can use a spot on your hard-drive with enough room and select guilabel`Delete Sequence After Rendering`.
Base Name
The base name of your image sequence. This will get suffixed with a number depending on the frame.
The file format to export the sequence to. When rendering we enforce png. The usual export options can be modified with guilabel``.
Once you're satisfied with your brush and its settings you need to do one last thing (but click guilabel`Overwrite Brush` first!)
It's time now to create the Brush Preview graphic. The simplest and easiest way to do this for a brush of this type is to clear out the ScratchPad using the guilabel`Reset` button. Now center your cursor in the Brush Preview square at the top of the ScratchPad and click once. You should see an image of your texture (in this case it would be the evergreen tree). In order to work correctly though the entire image should fit comfortably within the square. This might mean that you have to tweak the size of the brush. Once you have something you are happy with then click the guilabel`Overwrite Brush` button and your brush and its preview image will be saved.
An alternative method that requires a little more work but gives you greater control of the outcome is the following
Locate the Brush Preview thumbnail .KPP file in Krita and open it to get a 200x200 file that you can edit to your wishes.
You're ready to add the next texture!  From here on it's just a matter of wash rinse and repeat for each texture where you want to create a dedicated Brush Preset.

Now the algorithm will be possibly a lot faster allowing us to add strokes and press guilabel`Update` in rapid succession
To see the final result disable guilabel`Edit Key Strokes` or toggle the second to last icon on the colorize mask.
If you want to edit the strokes again re-enable guilabel`Edit Key Strokes`.
Now the colorize mask being a mask can also be added to a group of line art layers. It will then use the composition of the whole group as the line art. This is perfect for our background which has two separate line art layers. It also means that the colorize mask will be disabled when added to a group with pass-through enabled because those have no final composition. You can recognize a disabled colorize mask because its name is stricken through.
To add a colorize mask to a group select the group and |mouseleft| the canvas with the Colorize Mask editing tool or |mouseright| the layer to menuselection`Add --> Colorize Mask`.
Fast Mode
This is a special mode for really fast filling. However many functions don't work with this mode.
Determines when the fill-tool sees another color as a border.
This value extends the shape beyond its initial size.
Feathering Radius
If you click then press the kbd`Shift` key then move the layer movement is constrained to the horizontal and vertical directions. If you press the kbd`Shift` key then click then move all layers will be moved with the movement constrained to the horizontal and vertical directions
Constrained movement
Gives the top-left coordinate of the layer can also be manually edited.

Hotkeys and Sticky-keys
There's no default hotkey for switching to rectangle.
If you hold the kbd`Shift` key while drawing a square will be drawn instead of a rectangle. Holding the kbd`Ctrl` key will change the way the rectangle is constructed. Normally the first mouse click indicates one corner and the second click the opposite. With the kbd`Ctrl` key the initial mouse position indicates the center of the rectangle and the final mouse position indicates a corner. You can press the kbd`Alt` key while still keeping |mouseleft| down to move the rectangle to a different location.
You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner drawing methods as often as you want by pressing or releasing the kbd`Ctrl` key provided that you keep |mouseleft| pressed. With the kbd`Ctrl` key pressed mouse movements will affect all four corners of the rectangle (relative to the center) without the kbd`Ctrl` key one of the corners is unaffected.
Not filled
Break the path at this point.
Break Segment
Break the path at the selected segment.
Join with Segment
Join two nodes that are only attached on one side with a segment.
This contains features with which to create new texts the following items are available
The letter type used by newly created texts.
Size in pt
The letter-size used by newly created texts. It is in pts (points) which is a common standard for fonts that is measured 72 points per inch. It therefore will stay proportionally the same size if you increase or decrease canvas dpi.

Krita's transform tool reference.
|tooltransform|
The Transform tool lets you quickly transform the current selection or layer. Basic transformation options include resize rotate and skew. In addition you have the option to apply advanced transforms such as Perspective Warp Cage and Liquid. These are all powerful options and will give you complete control over your selections/layers.
When you first invoke the tool  handles will appear at the corners and sides which you can use to resize your selection or layer. You can perform rotations by moving the mouse above or to the left of the handles and dragging it. You can also click anywhere inside the selection or layer and move it by dragging the mouse.
You can fine-tune the transform tool parameters using tool options docker. The parameters are split between five tabs Free Transform Warp Perspective Cage and Liquify.

Now go to menuselection`Filters --> G'MIC --> Black  white --> Colorize[comics]`. In the G'MIC dialog box select guilabel`All` for input and guilabel`In place (default)` for output select guilabel`Lineart + color spots + extrapolated layers` for both input and output layers on the right-hand side. Smoothness is for filling gap tolerance and details the default is 0.5 you can adjust it according to your line art.
Press **Apply** and **Ok** to apply and exit the G'MIC dialog. You'll now have flat colors beneath your line art. More details about this technique can be found in the tutorial `at Timothée Giet's blog `.
Starting from chaos
Here you start by making a mess through random shapes and texture then taking inspirations from the resulting chaos you can form various concepts. It is kind of like making things from clouds or finding recognizable shapes of things in abstract and random textures. Many concept artists work with this technique.
You can use brushes like the shape brush or the spray brush to paint a lot of different shapes and from the resulting noise you let your brain pick out shapes and compositions.

Do you make smooth ‘wet’ strokes? Or do you make textured ones? For the longest time smooth strokes were preferred as that would be less of a headache when entering the coloring phase. Within Krita there are several methods to color these easily the colorize mask being the prime example so textured becomes a viable option even for the lazy amongst us.
Left No texture Center Textured Right Predefined Brush tip
Of course the nicest lines are made with pressure sensitivity so they dynamically change from thick to thin. However different types of curves on the pressure give different results. The typical example is a slightly concave line to create a brush that more easily makes thin lines.
InkGpen25 is a good example of a brush with a concave pressure curve. This curve makes it easier to make thin lines.
conversely here's a convex brush. The strokes are much rounder
This'll make the color rate decrease and turn it into a smudge brush as the stroke continues
The **Fade** sensor will base the stroke length on brush size. The **Distance** sensor will base it on actual pixels and the **Time** on actual seconds.
Then select menuselection`Brushtip --> Predefined` and select the default *AAngularChurchHR* brushtip.
This makes for a nice textured square brush.
Of course this'll make the stroke distance longer to get to smudging so we go back to the *Opacity*.
We can make it animatable by adding a frame to the timeline. |mouseright| a frame in the timeline to get a context menu. Choose guilabel`New Frame`.
.. image images/animation/Introductiontoanimation07.png
You can see it has become an animated layer because of the onion skin icon showing up in the timeline docker.
.. image images/animation/Introductiontoanimation08.png
Use the guilabel`Copy Frame` button to copy the first frame onto the second. Then use the with the kbd`Shift + ↑` shortcut to move the frame contents up.
If you start Krita again after it crashed and try to open your original file Krita will ask you whether to open the AutoSave file instead
.. image images/autosavenamedrestore.png
If you choose "no" the AutoSave file will be removed. The work that has been done since the last time you saved your file yourself will be lost and cannot be retrieved.
If you choose "yes" the AutoSave file will be opened then removed. The file you have open will have the name of your original file. The file will be set to Modified so the next time you try to close Krita Krita will ask you whether you want to save the file. If you choose No your work is irretrievably gone. It cannot be restored.
If you use "Save As" your image will be saved under a new name. The original file under its own name and its AutoSave file are not deleted. From now on your file will be saved under the new name; if you save again an AutoSave file will be created using the new filename.
Gamut masks can be imported and exported in bundles in the Resource Manager. See ref`resourcemanagement` for more information.
Welcome to the Krita Manual! In this section we'll try to get you up to speed.
If you are familiar with digital painting we recommend checking out the ref`introductionfromothersoftware` category which contains guides that will help you get familiar with Krita by comparing its functions to other software.
If you are new to digital art just start with ref`installation` which deals with installing Krita and continue on to ref`startingwithkrita` which helps with making a new document and saving it ref`basicconcepts` in which we'll try to quickly cover the big categories of Krita's functionality and finally ref`navigation` which helps you find basic usage help such as panning zooming and rotating.
When you have mastered those you can look into the dedicated introduction pages for functionality in the ref`usermanual` read through the overarching concepts behind (digital) painting in the ref`generalconcepts` section or just search the ref`referencemanual` for what a specific button does.
Blending modes can be done per layer or per brush stroke and thus are also part of the compositing of layers.
A commonly used blending mode is for example menuselection`Multiply` which multiplies the components leading to darker colors. This allows you to simulate the subtractive mixing and thus makes painting shadows much easier.
Another common one is menuselection`Addition` which adds one layer's components to the other making it perfect for special glow effects.
menuselection`Erasing` is a blending mode in Krita. There is no eraser tool but you can toggle on the brush quickly with the kbd`E` key to become an eraser. You can also use it on layers. Unlike the other blending modes this one only affects the alpha channel making things more transparent.
The menuselection`Normal` blend mode just averages between colors depending on how transparent the topmost color is.
If you encounter any problems or if you are new to compiling software don't hesitate to contact the Krita developers. There are three main communication channels
irc irc.freenode.net channel #krita
`mailing list `
`forums `
.. image images/Interface-tour.svg
kbd`Ctrl + Shift + A` deselect All (and not the kbd`Ctrl + D` shortcut as in PS)
Note for Gimp user Krita auto-expands and auto defloats new layers created from a selection after pressing the kbd`Ctrl + C` kbd`Ctrl + V` shortcuts so you do not have to worry about not being able to paint outside the pasted element.
This doesn't work as intended right now. Intersect is a selection mode which use the kbd`T` key as the shortcut. However the kbd`T` key is also used to switch to the guilabel`Move tool` so this shortcut is not functional right now. You have to use the button on the guilabel`Tool Options`.
Layer Handling
The most common shortcuts are very similar in PS and Krita
How do you do that in Krita?
This section goes over the functionalities that Krita and Paint Tool Sai share but shows how they slightly differ.
Canvas navigation
Krita just like Sai allows you to flip rotate and duplicate the view. Unlike Sai these are tied to keyboard keys.
This is tied to kbd`M` key to flip.
Finished keys you will begin to draw the inbetweens. If you feel Krita is becoming slow I recommend you to merge key drafts and keys as well as to remove any unnecessary layers.
After finalizing keys and cleaning up unnecessary layers add inbetweenings using Time sheet and inbetweening drafts as reference.
This is its correspondence with Time sheet.
.. image images/animation/Inbetweening.png
Once the vector functionality of Krita becomes better I recommend you to use vector to finalize inbetweening.
It is by default collapsed so you will have to press the arrow at the top right of the brush settings to show it.
When saving a new preset you can choose to get the icon from the scratch pad this will load the dash area into the mini scratch pad of the Save New Brush Preset dialog.
The scratch pad has four buttons underneath it. These are in order for
Showing the current brush image
Adding a gradient to the scratch pad (useful for smudge brushes)
Enjoy your brushes!
How to use the canvas mirroring tools in Krita.
Mirror Tools
Draw on one side of a mirror line while the Mirror Tool copies the results to the other side. The Mirror Tools are accessed along the toolbar. You can move the location of the mirror line by grabbing the handle.
.. image images/Mirror-tool.png
What is Python Scripting?
Python is a scripting language that can be used to automate tasks. What python scripting in Krita means is that we added an API to krita which is a bit of programming that allows python to access to parts of Krita. With this we can make dockers perform menial tasks on a lot of different files and even write our own exporters. People who work with computer graphics like VFX and video game artists use python a lot to make things like sprite sheets automate parts of export and more.
It is outside the scope of this manual to teach you python itself. However as python is an extremely popular programming language and great for beginners there's tons of learning material around that can be quickly found with a simple 'learn python' internet search.
This manual will instead focus on how to use python to automate and extend Krita. For that we'll first start with the basics How to run Python commands in the scripter.
How to Enable the Scripter Plugin
The tool tip this will show up on hover-over.
iconText
The text it will show when displayed in a toolbar. So for example "Resize Image to New Size" could be shortened to "Resize Image" to save space so we'd put that in here.
activationFlags
This determines when an action is disabled or not.
When creating a selection you can select what type of selection you want from the Mode in the selection tool options Pixel or Vector. By default this will be a vector.
Vector selections can be modified as any other ref`vector shape ` with the ref`shapeselectiontool` if you try to paint on a vector selection mask it will be converted into a pixel selection. You can also convert vector shapes to selection. In turn vector selections can be made from vector shapes and vector shapes can be converted to vector selections using the options in the guilabel`Selection` menu. Krita will add a new vector layer for this shape.
One of the most common reasons to use vector selections is that they give you the ability to move and transform a selection without the kind of resize artifacts you get with a pixel selection. You can also use the ref`shapeedittool` to change the anchor points in the selection allowing you to precisely adjust bezier curves or add corners to rectangular selections.
If you started with a pixel selection you can still convert it to a vector selection to get these benefits. Go to menuselection`Select --> Convert to Vector Selection`.
If you have multiple levels of transparency when you convert a selection to vector you will lose the semi-transparent values.
Select the existing tag that you want to have removed from the drop-down. Press the guilabel`+` icon next to the tag. You will get an option to remove it.
The default brushes that come with Krita cannot have their default tags removed.
How to use document templates in Krita.
.. image images/KritaNewFileTemplateA.png
Templates are just .kra files which are saved in a special location so it can be pulled up by Krita quickly. This is like the guilabel`Open Existing Document and Untitled Document` but then with a nicer place in the UI.
If you come in from a program like program`Paint Tool Sai` then using this option or using guilabel`Set Canvas Background Color` in the new file options will allow you to work in a slightly more comfortable environment where transparency isn't depicted with checkered boxes.
Basic transforms
There are some basic transforms available in the image menu.
This will allow you to skew the whole image and its layers.
This will allow you to rotate the image and all its layers quickly.
There is another thing you should keep in mind when using data from books or similar copyright violation. As a rule of thumb you might say that individual word translations can be used from books but not entire sections (The data isn't copyrighted but the collection of data is).
Also books out of copyright can be used for data (in the US this means mainly pre-1923 books). Have a look at project Gutenberg at Projekt Gutenberg-DE (German site) or www.gutenberg.org (English site) for more information about finding out if a book is out of copyright.
Despite the fact that all files can be loaded and used with both KWordQuiz and Parley you should keep in mind that KWordQuiz has a simpler design and might ignore some features from the files. If you work with KWordQuiz and save afterwards you might lose some properties that are available in Parley. For that reason the table above lists advanced features that are only available in Parley. Minor features like the names of lessons are not mentioned though they get lost with KWordQuiz. It is expected that this limitation will be removed in the next major version of KDE.
Removing Grades Using Parley you should be able to remove grades from the files by using Edit -> Remove Grades.
Please send your contributed files to the KDE-Edu mailing list so they can be uploaded on this page.

New functions have entered Konsole
Tiled Rendering Improves Okular Performance
The KDE Development Platform 4.11
KDE Platform 4.11 Delivers Better Performance
This release of KDE Platform 4.11 continues to focus on stability. New features are being implemented for our future KDE Frameworks 5.0 release but for the stable release we managed to squeeze in optimizations for our Nepomuk framework.
KDE Software Compilation 4.11
August 14 2013. The KDE Community is proud to announce the latest major updates to the Plasma Workspaces Applications and Development Platform delivering new features and fixes while readying the platform for further evolution. The Plasma Workspaces 4.11 will receive long term support as the team focuses on the technical transition to Frameworks 5. This then presents the last combined release of the Workspaces Applications and Platform under the same version number.
Development Platform/KDE Frameworks 5
The modular Frameworks structure will have widespread benefits for KDE software. In addition Frameworks is a substantial contribution to the Qt ecosystem by making KDE technology available to all Qt developers. Inqlude the Qt library archive simplifies the search for Qt libraries while the alpha release of the Inqlude tool offers a command line interface for accessing Inqlude.
Plasma Workspaces
Plasma 5 was recently released after 3 years of work; it is on its own release schedule with feature releases every three months and bugfix releases in the intervening months. The Plasma team has built a solid foundation that will support Plasma Workspaces for many years.
KDE Applications 4.14 is not about lots of quot;new and improved stuffquot;. Many KDE developers are focused on the Next Experience (Plasma 5) or porting to KDE Frameworks (based on Qt5). Mostly the 4.14 release is needed by aspects of our workflow (such as translations). This release offers more software stability with little emphasis on new and less-proven stuff.
New KWalletManager user interface; changes to Okular
The 4.11 releases include the following highlights and more
Qt Quick in Plasma Workspaces—Qt Quick is continuing to make its way into the Plasma Workspaces. Plasma Quick KDEquot;s extensions on top of Qt Quick allow deeper integration and more powerful apps and Plasma components. One of the central Plasma widgets the task manager was completely rewritten in Plasma Quick. It got quite a few bug fixes on its way to the new QML version. The Battery widget was overhauled. It now shows information about all the batteries (e.g. mouse keyboard) in a system. And the battery icons can now show a finer-grained load-status.
Faster Nepomuk indexing—The Nepomuk semantic engine received massive performance optimizations (e.g. reading data is 6 or more times faster). Indexing happens in two stages the first stage retrieves general information (such as file type and name) immediately; additional information like MP3 tags author information and similar is extracted in a second somehow slower stage. Metadata display is now much faster. In addition the Nepomuk backup and restore system was improved. The system also got new indexers for documents like odt or docx.
Kontact improvements—Kontact got a faster indexer for its PIM data with improvements to Nepomuk and a new theme editor for email headers. The way it handles email images now allows it to resize pictures on the fly. The whole KDE PIM suite got a lot of bug fixes such as the way it deals with Google Calender resources. The PIM Import Wizard allows users to import settings and data from Trojita (the Qt IMAP email client) and all other importers were improved as well.

KDE Ships KDE Applications 15.04.0
April 15 2015. Today KDE released KDE Applications 15.04. With this release a total of 72 applications have been ported to KDE Frameworks 5. The team is striving to bring the best quality to your desktop and these applications. So we're counting on you to send your feedback.
In KGoldrunner we've added two new sets of levels one allowing digging while falling and one not. We've added solutions for several existing sets of levels. For an added challenge we now disallow digging while falling in some older sets of levels.
In KSudoku you can now print Mathdoku and Killer Sudoku puzzles. The new multi-column layout in KSudoku's Welcome Screen makes it easier to see more of the many puzzle types available and the columns adjust themselves automatically as the window is resized. We've done the same to Palapeli making it easier to see more of your jigsaw puzzle collection at once.
We've also included stability fixes for games like KNavalBattle Klickety KShisen and KTuberling and the overall experience is now greatly improved. KTuberling Klickety and KNavalBattle have also been updated to use the new KDE Frameworks 5.
Important Fixes
Don't you simply hate it when your favorite application crashes at the most inconvinient time? We do too and to remedy that we've worked very hard at fixing lots of bugs for you but probably we've left some sneak so don't forget to report them!
Kolourpaint Cervisia and KDiskFree have now been ported to KDE Frameworks 5 and we look forward to your feedback and insight into the newest features introduced with this release.
In the continued effort to split Kontact Suite libraries to make them easier to use for third parties the kdepimlibs tarball has been split into akonadi-contacts akonadi-mime and akonadi-notes.
We have discontinued the following packages kdegraphics-strigi-analyzer kdenetwork-strigi-analyzers kdesdk-strigi-analyzers libkdeedu and mplayerthumbs. This will help us focus in the rest of the code.
Keeping in Kontact
The Kontact Suite has got the usual round of cleanups bug fixes and optimizations in this release. Notable is the use of QtWebEngine in various compontents which allows for a more modern HTML rendering engine to be used. We have also improved VCard4 support as well as added new plugins that can warn if some conditions are met when sending an email e.g. verifying that you want to allow sending emails with a given identity or checking if you are sending email as plaintext etc.
The developers of KAlgebra are on their own particular road to convergence having ported the mobile version of the comprehensive educational program to Kirigami 2.0 -- the preferred framework for integrating KDE applications on desktop and mobile platforms.
Furthermore the desktop version has also migrated the 3D back-end to GLES the software that allows the program to render 3D functions both on the desktop and on mobile devices. This makes the code simpler and easier to maintain.
KDE's video editor is becoming more stable and more full-featured with every new version. This time the developers have redesigned the profile selection dialog to make it easier to set screen size framerate and other parameters of your film.
Now you can also play your video directly from the notification when rendering is finished. Some crashes that happened when moving clips around on the timeline have been corrected and the DVD Wizard has been improved.
Our favorite file explorer and portal to everything (except maybe the underworld) has had several makeovers and usability improvements to make it even more powerful.
Some Linux/UNIX OS vendors have kindly provided binary packages of KDE Applications 17.12 Release Candidate (internally 17.11.90) for some versions of their distribution and in other cases community volunteers have done so. Additional binary packages as well as updates to the packages now available may become available over the coming weeks.
Compiling KDE Applications 17.12 Release Candidate
The complete source code for KDE Applications 17.12 Release Candidate may be freely downloaded. Instructions on compiling and installing are available from the KDE Applications 17.12 Release Candidate Info Page.
KDE Ships KDE Applications 17.12.0
December 14 2017. KDE Applications 17.12.0 are now released.
Lots of visual papercuts were fixed e.g. in the URL bar for the full screen toolbar and for the thumbnail tooltip animations. Missing icons were added as well.
Last but not least the full screen hover button will directly view the image instead of showing the folder's content and the advanced settings now allow for more control over the ICC color rendering intent.
In Okular KDE's universal document viewer PDF rendering and text extraction can now be cancelled if you have poppler version 0.63 or higher which means that if you have a complex PDF file and you change the zoom while it's rendering it will cancel immediately instead of waiting for the render to finish.
You will find improved PDF JavaScript support for AFSimpleCalculate and if you have poppler version 0.64 or higher Okular will support PDF JavaScript changes in read-only state of forms.
Management of booking confirmation emails in KMail KDE's powerful email client has been significantly enhanced to support train bookings and uses a Wikidata-based airport database for showing flights with correct timezone information. To make things easier for you a new extractor has been implemented for emails not containing structured booking data.
When the share button is clicked and kipi-plugins are not installed Gwenview will prompt the user to install them. After the installation they are immediately displayed.
Sidebar now prevents getting hidden accidentally while resizing and remembers its width.
KMail KDE's powerful email client features some improvements in the travel data extraction engine. It now supports UIC 918.3 and SNCF train ticket barcodes and Wikidata-powered train station location lookup. Support for multi-traveler itineraries was added and KMail now has integration with the KDE Itinerary app.
Akonadi the personal information management framework is now faster thanks to notification payloads and features XOAUTH support for SMTP allowing for native authentication with Gmail.
Cantor KDE's frontend to mathematical software now saves the status of panels ("Variables" "Help" etc.) for each session separately. Julia sessions have become much faster to create.
The search bar once again closes when you hit the Escape key
Lokalize KDE's translation tool
Hide translated files on the Project tab
Added basic support of pology the syntax and glossary checking system
Simplified navigation with tab ordering and multi-tab opening
Okular now supports viewing and verifying digital signatures in PDF files.
Thanks to improved cross-application integration Okular now supports editing LaTeX documents in TexStudio.
Improved support for touchscreen navigation means you will be able to move backwards and forwards using a touchscreen when in Presentation mode.
Users who prefer manipulating documents from the command-line will be able to perform smart text search with the new command-line flag that lets you open a document and highlight all occurrences of a given piece of text.
Okular now properly displays links in Markdown documents that span more than one line.
The information panel (located by default to the right of the main Dolphin panel) has been improved in several ways. You can for example choose to auto-play media files when you highlight them in the main panel and you can now select and copy the text displayed in the panel. If you want to change what the information panel shows you can do so right there in the panel as Dolphin does not open a separate window when you choose to configure the panel.
We have also solved many of the paper cuts and small bugs ensuring that your experience of using Dolphin is much smoother overall.
Dolphin new bookmark feature
Gwenview is KDE's image viewer and in this release the developers have improved its thumbnail viewing feature across the board. Gwenview can now use a "Low resource usage mode" that loads low-resolution thumbnails (when available). This new mode is much faster and more resource-efficient when loading thumbnails for JPEG images and RAW files. In cases when Gwenview cannot generate a thumbnail for an image it now displays a placeholder image rather than re-using the thumbnail of the previous image. The problems Gwenview had with displaying thumbnails from Sony and Canon cameras have also been solved.
Apart from changes in the thumbnail department Gwenview has also implemented a new “Share” menu that allows sending images to various places and correctly loads and displays files in remote locations accessed using KIO. The new version of Gwenview also displays vastly more EXIF metadata for RAW images.
The KDE Frameworks—designed as drop-in Qt Addons—will enrich Qt as a development environment with libraries providing functions that simplify accelerate and reduce the cost of Qt development. Frameworks eliminate the need to reinvent key functionality.
The transition from Platform to Frameworks has been underway for almost three years and is being implemented by a team of about 20 (paid and volunteer) developers and actively supported by four companies. Frameworks 5 consists of 57 modules 19 independent libraries (Qt Addons) not requiring any dependencies; 9 that require libraries which themselves are independent; and 29 with more significant dependency chains. Frameworks are developed following the Frameworks Policies in a vendor neutral open process.
This KDE News article has more background on Frameworks 5.
Available today
The tech preview made available today contains all 57 modules that are part of Frameworks 5. Of these two have a maturity level that shows the direction of Frameworks ThreadWeaver and KArchive. Developers are invited to take all of the modules for a spin and provide feedback (and patches) to help bring them to the same level of maturity.

Where Your Donations Go
Sprints are in person meetings and are really important for a team of hardworking volunteers around the world to focus their efforts and discuss technical matters around the project. The amount of output we get from the sprints is really worthwhile for all users of the software.
Remaining money gets spent on our infrastructure we have a large portfolio of servers hosting websites code continuous integration and a lot more. A full breakdown can be seen in our quarterly reports.
We will use your paypal email address to contact you and ask for the addresses to send the postcards mid-November.
Selecting Items Using the Mouse
You can press the LMB; somewhere in the view and draw a rectangle around a group of items before releasing the button. This will select all items in the rectangle and clear the previous selection. If the Shift; key is pressed during the selection process the previous selection is kept.
If the Ctrl; key is pressed while an item is clicked with the LMB; the selection state of this item is toggled. If the Ctrl; key is pressed while a rectangle is drawn around a group of items as described above the selection state of all items in the rectangle will be toggled.
If the Shift; key is pressed while an item is clicked with the LMB; all items between the previous current item and the clicked item will be selected.
If Show selection marker is enabled in the Behavior tab of the General section of the settings a small + or - button appears in the top left corner of the item which is currently hovered over with the mouse. Clicking this sign selects or deselects the item respectively.
Confirmations Tab
In the ask for confirmation section you can enable warning dialogs that are shown before potentially harmful actions.
It is also possible to choose the default action When opening an executable file. There are three options namely Always ask Open in application and Run script.
The confirmation settings for Moving files or folders to trash and Deleting files or folders affect file operations in dolphin; konqueror; Gwenview and all kde; applications using the default kde; file dialog whereas Closing Dolphin windows with multiple tabs is a dolphin; specific setting.
Status Bar Tab
Pastes the currently copied/cut items to the current folder. If the clipboard does not contain files or folders the clipboard contents (such as text or image data) will be pasted into a new file. The name of this file has to be entered in a dialog.
 Ctrl;F  Edit Search
Opens the find bar. Enter a search term into the edit box and select to search for filename or in contents of files starting from the current folder or everywhere.
 Ctrl;A  Edit Select All
Selects all files and folders in the current folder.

If you do have write permission changes will be saved transparently over the network.

Show a search field and a list of opened files in the editor area. While entering text in the search field the document names and document URL;s are searched for matching text. While entering text in the search field you can use the cursor keys Up and Down to navigate in the list view. Pressing the Enter; key or double clicking on an item in the list switches the view to the document selected in the list view. This makes switching between documents easier if there are a lot of them open.
This action is available also using the  icon at the top right of the editor window.

The styles and colors used by each syntax highlight definition can be configured using the Highlighting Text Styles tab of the Config Dialog while the MIME; Types and file extensions it should be used for are handled by the Modes amp; Filetypes tab.
The kappname; Syntax Highlight System
This section will discuss the kappname; syntax highlighting mechanism in more detail. It is for you if you want to know about it or if you want to change or create syntax definitions.
How it Works
Whenever you open a file one of the first things the kappname; editor does is detect which syntax definition to use for the file. While reading the text of the file and while you type away in it the syntax highlighting system will analyze the text using the rules defined by the syntax definition and mark in it where different contexts and styles begin and end.
dsVariable if applicable variable names (e.g. $someVar in PHP/Perl).
dsControlFlow control flow keywords like if else switch break return yield
dsOperator operators like + - * /  lt; gt;
dsBuiltIn built-in functions classes and objects.
dsExtension common extensions such as Qt classes and functions/macros in C++ and Python.
lt;Int (common attributes) /gt;
This rule has no specific attributes.
Detect a floating point number (as the regular expression (\b[0-9]+\.[0-9]*|\.[0-9]+)([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?).
lt;Float (common attributes) /gt;
HlCOct
Constructor. Returns a Cursor at position (0 0).
Constructor. Returns a Cursor at position (line column).
Example var cursor = new Cursor(3 42);
Copy constructor. Returns a copy of the cursor other.
Cursor.setPosition(int line int column);
Returns true if the given cursor position is positioned at a valid text position. A text position is valid only if it locate at the start in the middle or the end of a valid line. Further a text position is invalid if it is located in a Unicode surrogate.
Returns the attribute at the given cursor position.
Returns true if the attribute at the given cursor position equals attribute otherwise false.
Returns the attribute name as human readable text. This is equal to the itemData name in the syntax highlighting files.
Returns true if the attribute name at a certain cursor position matches the given name otherwise false.

The scrollbars indicate the position of the visible part of the document text and can be used to move around the document. Dragging the scrollbars will not cause the insertion cursor to be moved.
The scrollbars are displayed and hidden as required.
The Icon Border
The icon border is a small pane on the left side of the editor displaying a small icon next to marked lines.
You can set or remove a bookmark in a visible line by clicking the LMB; in the icon border next to that line.
An indenter for C and similar languages such as C++ C# java javascript and so on. This indenter will not work with scripting languages such as Perl or PHP.
An indenter for the functional programming language Haskell.
Lilypond
An indenter for the Lilypond notation language for music.
An indenter specifically for the Lisp scripting language and Lisp dialects.
A lookbehind assertion is a sub pattern starting with either ?lt;= or ?lt;!.
Lookbehind has the same effect as the lookahead but works backwards. For example to match the literal string fruit but only if not preceded by grape you could use this expression (?lt;!grape)fruit.
Characters with a special meaning inside patterns
The following characters have meaning inside a pattern and must be escaped if you want to literally match them
The escape character.
VI’s behavior for the Y command is in practice a bug. For both change and delete commands cc/ dd will do its action on the current line and C/D will work from the cursor column to the end of the line. However both yy and Y yanks the current line. In kappname;’s VI Mode Y will yank to the end of the line. This is described as more logical in the Vim documentation.
kappname; O and o opens [count] new lines and puts you in insert mode.
Vim O and o opens a new line and inserts text [count] times when leaving insert mode.
This is mostly done as a consequence of witnessing many people being confused by this behavior on a vim irc channel (#vim on freenode).

This dialog allows you to configure the history sidebar.
The options in this section can be used to set the maximum size of your history and set a time after which items are automatically removed.
Here you can also set different fonts for new and old URL;s by selecting the Choose Font button.
The Detailed tooltips check box controls how much information is displayed when you hover the mouse pointer over an item in the history page.
If checked the number of times visited and the dates of the first and last visits are shown in addition to the URL.
You can either opt to have konqueror; automatically detect the Java; installation on your system or specify the path to the installation yourself by selecting Path to Java executable or 'java'. You may want to choose the latter method for instance if you have multiple Java; installations on your system and want to specify which one to use. If the Java; Virtual Machine you are using requires any special startup options you can type them in the text box labeled Additional Java arguments.
Despite the name JavaScript is not related at all to Java;.
The first part of this tab works the same as the Java; settings.
The checkbox Enable JavaScript globally allows you to turn JavaScript support on for all web sites by default. You can also select to turn JavaScript on or off for specific hosts. To add a policy for a specific host click the New button to bring up a dialog in which you can type the host name and then choose to accept or reject JavaScript code from that particular host which will add the domain to the list on the left of the page.
The final set of options in the section Global JavaScript Policies determine what happens when a page uses JavaScript for specific actions.

The menus contain the following entries
Print the contents of the currently visible page. Handbooks in PDF format you find on the  kde; Documentation Server.
Close and exit khelpcenter;
 Ctrl;C  EditCopy
Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
Right click on the Status Bar at the bottom of a window or view to add or remove a view and lock or link views within konqueror;'s window.
Viewing Help Man and Info Pages
You can view kde; Help and UNIX; Man and Info pages directly in konqueror; without having to start up khelpcenter;.
To view a kde; Help page enter help/application name (for example help/kmail to view the kmail; documentation.) into konqueror;'s Location Toolbar window.
If you want to read UNIX; Man pages konqueror; makes it easy. For example type man/touch or #touch into the Location Toolbar to see the page for the touch command.
Use the Menubar EditSelection Select Matching Items option or the shortcut Ctrl;S. This brings up a little dialog box in which you enter a filename containing the wildcard characters * which matches any number of characters and ? which matches a single character. Press OK and konqueror; will highlight all files with matching names. For example
flag*.png will select all filenames starting with the letters flag and ending with .png.
memo?.txt will select memo1.txt and memo9.txt but not memo99.txt.
When you have selected a range of files you can narrow down the selection by using the Menubar EditSelection Unselect Matching Items option to specify which of the selected files should be removed from the selection.
Use the Menubar EditSelection Unselect All option or just LMB; click on a clear area of the view to cancel the selection.
With FTP; you can see files and folders on the distant computer just as if they were on your own system download them onto your computer using konqueror;'s normal Copy and Paste or Drag n' Drop methods and if allowed upload files from your machine to the other computer's filesystem. To try it type the URL;
ftp//ftp.l10n.kde.org
into the Location Toolbar and press Enter. As long as you are connected to the Internet you should end up seeing the ftp folder of the l10n server.
Although strictly speaking FTP; URL;s should be entered starting with ftp// and WWW  URL;s starting with http// konqueror; is usually smart enough to figure out what is meant and insert these characters for you if you leave them out.
When you access an FTP; site it will usually need some form of username and password from you. To simplify things most FTP; sites that offer files for free downloading will accept the word  anonymous as a username and your email address as a password and to make your life even easier konqueror; will automatically supply these without troubling you.
For drawing algorithms in tree maps the rule that the area is proportional to the metric of an item should hold true. With the tree map in fsview; this goal isn't always met we draw borders to show the nesting of items and this border takes space for an item which is possibly lost for the areas of child items. Note that less space is lost for the border if the rectangle is quadratic.
Similarly it is better for a good overview to let each rectangle at least have its name as a label. It is an option to always force space for labels or only to draw labels when empty space is available. In the latter case the tool tips appearing when the mouse is held over an item can help a lot. They show information for the item the mouse is currently over together with its parent folders up to the root item of the tree map.
How the space of an item is split into subareas for children is left to the implementation. It is always better to try to split areas in such a way that rectangles are as quadratic as possible both for labeling and less space lost by borders. The best methods in this regard are Rows Columns or Recursive Bisection.
You can choose the minimal area of items to be drawn via the menu item ViewStop at Area. Instead a hash pattern will be drawn over the parents area to signal that this space is in fact occupied by a child or children.
fsview; supports multiple selection of items similar to the iconview and listview. This allows for actions to be done simultaneously to a set of files. A simple mouse click always selects a single item below the mouse pointer. Use a mouse click in combination with pressing the Shift; key for range selection or the Ctrl; key for selection toggle. Note that by selecting an item subitems can no longer be selected. Selecting an item will also clear the selection of all its parent items before.

Database objects (tables queries etc;) listed in the Project Navigator can be opened by clicking (or double-clicking depending upon your global KDE settings) on their names.
Main application elements
Main elements of kexi; application's window are
Tabbed Toolbar
Contains available commands for the application. You will find detailed description of any of the commands in the appendix.
Every table field must have a name and a caption these cannot be empty.
Field name is a word used by the database usually not visible for users of the database application. The name may not contain special (national) characters (like ± ¶ Ü) or space characters. The name must only contain roman letters numbers and underscore sign . Use the latter instead of spaces or dashes.
Field names must be started with a letter or underscore sign  never with a number.
It does not matter whether you are using small or capital letters. For kexi; the field name Persons is the same as persons.
Field caption on the other hand allows you to enter any letters and special characters. It will be displayed for users of the database application.
Click the first text field widget at the top of the form.
In the      (Data Source) tab of the property pane enter field name name in the Widget's data source drop down list. Alternatively you can select this name from the drop down list.
Click on next text field widget and enter surname as the data source.
Enter data sources for street housenumber and city text fields in a similar way.
You can now save the form's design (this is not mandatory to test the form in action). To save click the Save toolbar button. Upon saving you will be asked for entering the form's name. Enter Persons as caption and click the OK button. The form's name will be filled automatically.
The External Data Tab
From the External Data Tab you can you can import data from other sources into your kexi; project.
Import Data From File displays a dialog that allows you to import data from CSV or plain text files to a new table in your project.
Import Tables opens the Table Importing Wizard that allows you to import data either from a fods mdb ods tsv file or from another database server to a new table in your project.
Export Data to File displays a dialog that allows you to export the current tables data to a plain text or CSV file.
Limiting data view
A spreadsheet displays all rows and columns of the table which is bothersome in case of very large data sheets. You may of course filter and sort rows in spreadsheets however you must be extra careful while doing so. Spreadsheet users are in risk of forgetting that their data view has been filtered what can lead to mistakes. For example while calculating sums you may think you have 100 rows of data while in fact there are 20 rows more hidden.
If you want to work on a small subset of data eg; to send it for others to edit you can copy and paste it to another spreadsheet and after editing paste the changed data back to the main spreadsheet. Such manual editing may cause data loss or incorrect calculations.
To limit the data view database applications offer queries forms and reports.
A very practical way of limiting is the following extended version of the previously described table Persons

If you select a cell and choose Series from the Insert menu you will see the Series dialog box. This is useful for creating series that are too long to be conveniently constructed using the Drag and Copy method or for creating geometric series such as 1 1.5 2.25 3.375 where the step value 1.5 in this case is used as a multiplier.
If the type of series that you want is too complicated for any of the previous methods consider using a formula and Drag and Copying that. For example to create a series with the values 2 4 16 256 enter 2 into A1 =A1*A1 into A2 and Drag and Copy cell A2 down.
Formulae
Built in Functions
sheets; has a huge range of built in mathematical and other functions that can be used in a formula cell. They can be seen and accessed by selecting a cell then choosing Function from the Insert menu. This brings up the Function dialog box.
Note that this feature only checks data that you enter into the cell for a way of checking the results from formulae cells see the Conditional Cell Attributes section of this Handbook.
Document Protection
Protecting the document means that without the password a user cannot add or delete sheets. Document protection does not protect cells.
Select ToolsProtect Document A dialog appears asking you for a password. The Password strength meter indicates if your password is secure enough. The longer the indicator is the more secure your password.
The Protect Document dialog
Entering data into a cell can be as simple as selecting the cell typing your data then pressing Enter; or moving the selection to another cell with one of the arrow keys. Depending on how you enter the data sheets; will interpret it as a number date time or text
Numbers are entered in the obvious way; 123  -123 456.7 or in scientific notation -1.2E-5.
Dates should be entered in your System format as defined in the systemsettings; in Locale  Country/Region amp; LanguageDate amp; Time  tab. If for example you are using the DD/MM/YYYY form you should enter 30/03/2012 for 30th March 2012. Leading zeroes can be omitted from the day and month fields and only the last one or two digits of the year need to be entered if the date is in the current century for example 9/1/9 for 9th January 2009.
Times should also be entered using the System format. For example if you are using a 12 hour clock then enter times in HHMIN am|pm or HHMINSS am|pm format such as 942 am or  103052 pm.

The Toolbars
Manipulating the Toolbars
In addition to the menus stage; also has a toolbar. The toolbar consists of a collection of icons. A toolbar icon often presents a convenient shortcut to a command that is found in one of the menus.
You can move the unlocked toolbar around by dragging the handle at the left. The unlocked toolbar can be docked or attached to any side of the stage; window. If you like you can also have the toolbar float in its own window separated from the main stage; window.

Altitude vs. Time Plotter
This tool plots the altitude of any objects as a function of time for any date and location on Earth. The top section is a graphical plot of altitude angle on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. The time is shown both as standard local time along the bottom and sidereal time along the top. The bottom half of the graph is shaded green to indicate that points in this region are below the horizon.
There are a few ways to add curves to the plot. The simplest way to add the curve of an existing object is to simply type its name in the Name input field and press Enter or the Plot button. If the text you enter is found in the object database the object's curve is added to the graph. You can also press the Find Object button to open the Find Object Window to select an object from the list of known objects. If you want to add a point that does not exist in the object database simply enter a name for the point and then fill in the coordinates in the RA and Dec input fields. Then press the Plot button to add the curve for your custom object to the plot (note that you have to pick a name that does not already exist in the object database for this to work).
When you add an object to the plot its altitude vs. time curve is plotted with a thick white line and its name is added to the listbox at the lower right. Any objects that were already present are plotted with a thinner red curve. You can choose which object is plotted with the thick white curve by highlighting its name in the listbox.
These curves show the objects' Altitude (angle above the horizon) as a function of time. When a curve passes from the lower half to the upper half the object has risen; when it falls back to the lower half it has set. For example in the screenshot the minor planet Quaoar is setting at around 1500 local time and is rising at about 0400 local time.

Actions for the Selected Object
Sharpless HII region Catalog is the Sharpless (Sh2) catalog of HII regions (diffuse nebulae).
Hickson Compact Groups is a catalog consisting of 99 compact groups of galaxies.
Tycho-2 Star Catalog is a catalog of more than 2.5 million of the brightest stars. It contains stars with a magnitude value from 8.0 to 12.5.
USNO NOMAD Catalog is a catalog of about 100 million stars with magnitude from 12.5 to 16.5. Note that is requires Tycho-2 to be installed.
The following is a summary of catalogs in KStars
kstars; can draw artificial satellites from many predefined groups. Thus you can select to display a particular group multiple groups or partially select subgroups. Under each group a list of individual satellites is presented. To select all satellites from a group you need to check the group checkbox. You can also select only the satellites of interest in each group. The satellites orbital elements can be updated via the internet by pressing the Update TLEs button. Another way for updating the satellites orbital elements is to use the  UpdatesUpdate satellites orbital elements in the Data menu. If you know the name of a desired satellite then you can use the search satellites method that kstars; provides. You need to enter the name of satellite in the Search satellites text box and the list will be reduced only to its best matches.
You can add new satellites to kstars; default satellites set by editing the kstars/data/satellites.dat file. As each line of this file is a group of satellites you need to add a new entry for your desired satellites group. An entry should have the following format Group Name;localfilename;url. For example Iridium;iridium.tle;http//celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/iridium.txt.
Supernovae Window
The Supernovae page allows you to decide if the supernovae are displayed or not by checking the Show supernovae checkbox. By default supernovae are drawn as small light orange + mark. As for satellites the color of supernovae can be easily customized using the Colors page.
You can configure kstars; to check for newly discovered supernovae on startup by checking the Check for Recent Supernovae on Startup checkbox. This way kstars; will be always up-to-date with the most recent supernovae. You can enable supernova alerts using the Enable Supernova alerts checkbox. Thus kstars; will automatically alert you every time it learns of a new supernova in the sky. You can set the magnitude limit for showing a supernova as well as magnitude limit for supernova alerts using the spin boxes control. The limiting magnitude is the faintest apparent magnitude of an skyobject that is visible with the naked-eye or a telescope.
The term given this missing mass is Dark Matter and those two words pretty well sum up everything we know about it at this point. We know there is Matter because we can see the effects of its gravitational influence. However the matter emits no detectable electromagnetic radiation at all hence it is Dark. There exist several theories to account for the missing mass ranging from exotic subatomic particles to a population of isolated black holes to less exotic brown and white dwarfs. The term missing mass might be misleading since the mass itself is not missing just its light. But what is exactly dark matter and how do we really know it exists if we cannot see it?
The story began in 1933 when Astronomer Fritz Zwicky was studying the motions of distant and massive clusters of galaxies specifically the Coma cluster and the Virgo cluster. Zwicky estimated the mass of each galaxy in the cluster based on their luminosity and added up all of the galaxy masses to get a total cluster mass. He then made a second independent estimate of the cluster mass based on measuring the spread in velocities of the individual galaxies in the cluster. To his suprise this second dynamical mass estimate was 400 times larger than the estimate based on the galaxy light.
Although the evidence was strong at Zwicky's time it was not until the 1970s that scientists began to explore this discrepancy comprehensively. It was at this time that the existence of Dark Matter began to be taken seriously. The existence of such matter would not only resolve the mass deficit in galaxy clusters; it would also have far more reaching consequences for the evolution and fate of the universe itself.
Another phenomenon that suggested the need for dark matter is the rotational curves of Spiral Galaxies. Spiral Galaxies contain a large population of stars that orbit the Galactic center on nearly circular orbits much like planets orbit a star. Like planetary orbits stars with larger galactic orbits are expected to have slower orbital speeds (this is just a statement of Kepler's 3rd Law). Actually Kepler's 3rd Law only applies to stars near the perimeter of a Spiral Galaxy because it assumes the mass enclosed by the orbit to be constant.
However astronomers have made observations of the orbital speeds of stars in the outer parts of a large number of spiral galaxies and none of them follow Kepler's 3rd Law as expected. Instead of falling off at larger radii the orbital speeds remain remarkably constant. The implication is that the mass enclosed by larger-radius orbits increases even for stars that are apparently near the edge of the galaxy. While they are near the edge of the luminous part of the galaxy the galaxy has a mass profile that apparently continues well beyond the regions occupied by stars.
The Debian packages are suitable for any Debian-based distribution (Ubuntu Mint etc;). If you downloaded the Debian Packages above for your FOV range you can install them from your favorite package manager or via the following command
sudo dpkg -i astrometry-data-*.deb
On the other hand if you downloaded the FITS index files directly copy them to /usr/share/astrometry directory.
It is recommended to use a download manager as such DownThemAll! for Firefox to download the Debian packages as browsers' built-in download manager may have problems with download large packages.

Ekos Guide Module enables autoguiding capability using either the powerful built-in guider or at your option external guiding via PHD2 or linguider. Using the internal guiding guider CCD frames are captured and sent to Ekos for analysis. Depending on the deviations of the guide star from its lock position guiding pulses corrections are sent to your mount Via any device that supports ST4 ports. Alternatively you may send the corrections to your mount directly if supported by the mount driver. Most of the GUI options in the Guide Module are well documented so just hover your mouse over an item and a tooltip will popup with helpful information.
To perform guiding you need to select a Guider CCD in Ekos Profile Setup. The telescope aperture and focal length must be set in the telescope driver. If the Guider CCD is attached to a separate Guide Scope you must also set the Guide Scope's Focal Length and Aperture. You can set these values under the Options tab of the telescope driver or from the Mount module. Autoguiding is a two-step process Calibration amp; Guiding.
Guiding introduction
During the two processes you must set the following
Guider Select the Guider CCD.
Constraints Constraints are conditions that must be met at all times during the observation job execution process. These include minimum target altitude minimum moon separation twilight observation and weather monitoring.
Completion Conditions Conditions that trigger completion of the observation job. The default selection is to simply mark the observation job as complete once the sequence process is complete. Additional conditions enable the user to repeat the sequence process indefinitely or up until a specific time.
You must select the Target and Sequence before you can add a job to the Scheduler. When the scheduler starts it evaluates all jobs in accord to the conditions and constraints specified and attempts to select the best job to execute. Selection of the job depends on a simple heuristic algorithm that scores each job given the conditions and constraints each of which is weighted accordingly. If two targets have identical conditions and constraints usually the higher priority target followed by higher altitude target is selected for execution. If no candidates are available at the current time the scheduler goes into sleep mode and wakes up when the next job is ready for execution.
Scheduler + Planner
The description above only tackles the Data Acquisition stage of the observatory workflow. The overall procedure typically utilized in an observatory can be summarized in three primary stages
Once thought to be a simple galaxy type ellipticals are now known to be quite complex objects. Part of this complexity is due to their amazing history ellipticals are thought to be the end product of the merger of two Spiral galaxies. You can view a computer simulation MPEG movie of such a merger at  this NASA HST webpage (warning the file is 3.4 MB).
Elliptical galaxies span a very wide range of sizes and luminosities from giant Ellipticals hundreds of thousands of light years across and nearly a trillion times brighter than the sun to dwarf Ellipticals just a bit brighter than the average globular cluster. They are divided to several morphological classes
cD galaxies
Immense and bright objects that can measure nearly 1 Megaparsec (3 million light years) across. These titans are only found near the centers of large dense clusters of galaxies and are likely the result of many galaxy mergers.

It is difficult to understand stars using just the apparent magnitudes. Imagine two stars in the sky with the same apparent magnitude so they appear to be equally bright. You cannot know just by looking if the two have the same intrinsic brightness; it is possible that one star is intrinsically brighter but further away. If we knew the distances to the stars (see the parallax article) we could account for their distances and assign Absolute magnitudes which would reflect their true intrinsic brightness. The absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude the star would have if observed from a distance of 10 parsecs (1 parsec is 3.26 light-years or 3.1 x 1018 cm). The absolute magnitude (M) can be determined from the apparent magnitude (m) and the distance in parsecs (d) using the formula
M = m + 5 - 5 * log(d) (note that M=m when d=10).
The modern magnitude scale is no longer based on the human eye; it is based on photographic plates and photoelectric photometers. With telescopes we can see objects much fainter than Hipparchus could see with his unaided eyes so the magnitude scale has been extended beyond 6th magnitude. In fact the Hubble Space Telescope can image stars nearly as faint as 30th magnitude which is one trillion times fainter than Vega.
A final note the magnitude is usually measured through a color filter of some kind and these magnitudes are denoted by a subscript describing the filter (ie; mV is the magnitude through a visual filter which is greenish; mB is the magnitude through a blue filter; mpg is the photographic plate magnitude etc;).
The Local Meridian
When we observe the sky we expect most objects to appear to move in a particular direction with the passing of time. The apparent motion of most bodies in the sky is from east to west. However it is possible to observe a body moving west to east such as an artificial satellite or space shuttle that is orbiting eastward. This orbit is considered Retrograde Motion.
Retrograde Motion is most often used in reference to the motion of the outer planets (Mars Jupiter Saturn and so forth). Though these planets appear to move from east to west on a nightly basis in response to the spin of the Earth they are actually drifting slowly eastward with respect to the stationary stars which can be observed by noting the position of these planets for several nights in a row. This motion is normal for these planets however and not considered Retrograde Motion. However since the Earth completes its orbit in a shorter period of time than these outer planets we occasionally overtake an outer planet like a faster car on a multiple-lane highway. When this occurs the planet we are passing will first appear to stop its eastward drift and it will then appear to drift back toward the west. This is Retrograde Motion since it is in a direction opposite that which is typical for planets. Finally as the Earth swings past the planet in its orbit they appear to resume their normal west-to-east drift on successive nights.
This Retrograde Motion of the planets puzzled ancient Greek astronomers and was one reason why they named these bodies planets which in Greek means wanderers.
The Script Builder Tool
KDE applications can be controlled externally from another program from a console prompt or from a shell script using the Inter-process communication protocol (DBus;). kstars; takes advantage of this feature to allow rather complex behaviors to be scripted and played back at any time. This can be used for example to create a classroom demo to illustrate an astronomical concept.
Used for observations in the visible field of view Optical Telescopes are mainly Refractors and Reflectors the difference between the two of them being the way of collecting light from a star.
Refracting Telescopes use two lenses in order to create an image a primary or objective lens which collects the incoming light forming an image in the focal plane and the eyepiece which is acting as a magnifying glass used for observing the final image. The two lenses are situated at opposite ends of a moving tube and the distance between the two of them can be adjusted in order to obtain the final image.
The largest refracting telescope in the world is at the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay Wisconsin. Built in 1897 it has a 1.02-m (40-in) objective and a focal length of 19.36 m.
Reflecting Telescopes on the other side use mirrors instead of lenses in order to obtain the final image. By replacing the objective lens with a mirror we obtain a focal point that lies on the path of the incoming light. An observer situated at this point could see an image but he would block part of the incoming light. The focal point of the principal mirror is called prime focus and this is also the name of the first category of reflecting telescopes. Thus prime focus telescopes use a mirror in order to collect light from a celestial object and by reflection the image of the object may be observed from the prime focus of the telescope. Other types of reflecting telescopes are Newtonian Cassegrain and Coude.
The Newtonian one uses an additional flat mirror placed in the vicinity of the prime focus in the path of the reflected light. This results in moving the focal point to a different location on one of the sides of the telescope more accessible for observing. Of course a mirror placed in the path of the reflected light will also block part of the incoming one but if the ratio of the surface aeries of the primary mirror to the second one is big enough the amount of the blocked incoming light is negligible.
Confusions and confusing terminology
Before talking more about working spaces some confusions and confusing terminology needs to be cleared up
First sRGB is both a working color space and an output color space for images intended for the web and for monitor display (if you have a spiffy new monitor with a gamut larger than the gamut covered by sRGB obviously you might want to reconsider what output profile to use to best take advantage of your wonderful and hopefully calibrated and profiled monitor but please convert your image to sRGB before sending it on to your friends!). sRGB is also the color space that a lot of home and mass-production commercial printers expect image files to be in when sent to the printer. It is also the color space that most programs assume if an image does not have an embedded color profile telling the program what color space should be used to interpret (translate) the RGB numbers. So if you choose to not use color-management your color-management choices are simple - set everything to sRGB.
Second all jpegs (or tiffs if you have an older Minolta Dimage camera) coming straight out of a camera (even if produced by point-and-shoots cameras that don't allow you to save a raw file) start life inside the camera as a raw file produced by the camera's A to D converter. The processor inside the camera interpolates the raw file assigns a camera profile translates the resulting RGB numbers to a working space (usually sRGB but sometimes you can choose AdobeRGB depending on the camera) does the jpeg compression and stores the jpeg file on your camera card. So jpegs (or tiffs) from your camera NEVER need to be assigned a camera or input profile which is then translated to a working space via a PCS. Jpegs from a camera are already in a working space.
Third in case anyone is unsure on this point note that an interpolated raw file is no longer a raw file - it has been interpolated and then output as a tiff whose RGB values need to be translated to a working space using the camera profile the PCS and lcms. Fourth (strictly for future reference) to introduce a bit of commonly heard color-management terminology here - the camera profile and your printer's color profile are both device dependent whereas the working space will be device-independent - it can be used with any image with any properly color-managed software without regard for where the image originated.
A color profile describes the color gamut of the device or space to which it belongs by specifying what real color in the real world corresponds to each trio of RGB values in the color space of the device (camera monitor printer) or working space.
The camera profile essentially says "for every RGB trio of values associated with every pixel in the image file produced from the raw file by the raw processing software "this RGB image file trio" corresponds to "that real color as seen by a real observer in the real world" (or rather as displayed on the IT8 target if you produced your own camera profile but it amounts to the same thing - the goal of profiling your camera is to make the picture of the target look like the target).
You cannot see an image by looking at its RGB values. Rather you see an image by displaying it on a monitor or by printing it. When you profile your monitor you produce a monitor profile that says "this RGB trio of values that the graphics card sends to the screen" will produce on the screen "that real color as seen by a real observer in the real world".
What the monitor profile and the camera profile have in common is the part (in italics above) about "that real color as seen by a real observer in the real world." Different trios of RGB numbers in respectively the monitor and camera color spaces point to the same real visible color in the real world. Real colors in the real world provide the reference point for translating between all the color profiles your image will ever encounter on its way from camera to screen to editing program to print or the web.
How can a color profile point to a real color in the real world?
How many discrete tonal steps are there in a digital image?
In an 8-bit image you have 256 tonal steps from solid black to solid white. In a 16-bit image theoretically you have 65536 steps. But remember those 16-bits started out as either 10 bits (=1024 steps) 12 bits (=4096 steps) or 14 bits (=16384 steps) as produced by the camera's A-to-D converter - the extra bits to reach 16-bits start out as just padding. The available tones are not distributed evenly from light to dark. In linear gamma mode (as the camera sensor sees things) there's a whole lot more tones in the highlights than in the shadows. Hence the advice if you shoot raw to "expose to the right but don't blow the highlights". See Ron Bigelow's articles on "why raw" for a full discussion of the distribution of available tones in a raw image.
Should I use a large-gamut or a small-gamut working space?
One major consideration in choosing a working space is that some working spaces are bigger than others meaning they cover more of the visible spectrum (and as a consequence include some imaginary colors - mathematical constructs that don't really exist). These bigger spaces offer the advantage of allowing you to keep all the colors captured by your camera and preserved by the LCMS conversion from your camera profile to the super-wide-gamut profile connection space and out again to your chosen working space.
But keeping all the possible colors comes at a price as explained below. And it seems that any given digital image likely only contains a small subset of all the possible visible colors that your camera is capable of capturing. This small subset is easily contained in one of the smaller working spaces (an exception requiring a larger color gamut would be a picture of a highly saturated object such as yellow daffodil).
This widget contains a visual graph of the intensity values of the active layer or selection (histogram). Below the graph are five sliders that can be clicked into and dragged to constrain and change the intensity level for the image. The left sliders position represents the dark areas and similarly the right position represents the light areas.
Using the Adjust Levels tool
The Adjust Levels Tool Dialog
Actually the easiest way to learn how to use it is to experiment by moving the three sliders around and watching how the image is affected.
On the right both an original and a target preview image is available. The target preview is updated dynamically according to the slider positions. On the left the following options are available
Using the Insert Text tool
This tool seems very intuitive to use. Type in your text and place it with the mouse. Use the block settings as you please. Choose the orientation color from a color space and fonts with all their properties. You will have to scale the font size to the image size the larger the image the larger the font has to be! Finally choose to add a border around the text and/or a semitransparent background. Voilà it's finished!
Any text setting you have chosen can always be changed as long as you don't click the OK button. In saved and reloaded images the text has become part of the image it cannot be changed anymore.

Correlation Increasing the Correlation may help reducing artifacts. The correlation can range from 0-1. Useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 eg; 0.95 and 0.99. Using a high value for the correlation will reduce the sharpening effect of the plug-in.
Noise filter Increasing the Noise filter parameter helps reducing artifacts. The Noise can range from 0-1 but values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. When the Noise value is too low eg; 0 the image quality will be horrible. A useful value is 0.03. Using a high value for the Noise will even blur the image further.
Gaussian Sharpness This is the radius for the Gaussian convolution filter. Use this parameter when your blurring is Gaussian (mostly due to previous blur filtering). In most cases you should leave this parameter to 0 because it causes nasty artifacts. When you use non-zero values you will probably have to increase the Correlation and/or Noise filter parameters too.
Matrix size This parameter determines the size of the transformation matrix. Increasing the Matrix Size may give better results especially when you have chosen large values for Circular Sharpness or Gaussian Sharpness. Note that the plug-in will become very slow when you select large values for this parameter. In most cases you should select a value in the range 3-10.
Save As and Load these buttons are used to do just that. Any Refocus parameters that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later.

From there everything is simple select a RAW image and open it in the editor. The color management widget will be displayed after the image has been processed in order to adjust color rendering. Without color management all images are very dark this is normal. You can experiment the various profiles you have in order to select the best input profile according to your image (some tends to be very neutral even a bit dull some gives more saturated results etc;).

Cropping a Photograph
Increasing image size (Restoration)
Many image editing programs use some kind of interpolation eg; spline interpolation to scale-up an image. digikam; uses a more sophisticated approach. The algorithm underlying Restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS lab in Caen/France and is a part of the CImg project.

The digikam; Database
Everyone knows about database it is used to store data. As all other photographs management programs digikam; too uses the database for some obvious reasons like avoiding data duplication reducing data redundancy a quick search engine and greater data integrity. Moreover the cost of data entry storage and retrieval are drastically reduced. Additionally any user can access the data using query language.
Talking in particular about digikam; the Albums Album Roots Tags Thumbnails Face Recognition Data Image Metadata File Paths Settings etc; are all stored in different database files.
The digikam; actually manages more than one databases. For convenience it is broadly categorized in three

Automatic metadata generation
How to go about all this metadata business? Firstly there are already a lot of automatically generated metadata EXIF data and Makernotes. If you have configured digikam; with your identity section all imported images will be imprinted with this data set which includes copyrights all automatic. If you have a GPS track recorded in parallel to your taking the photographs you can geolocate those images in a single action using the Geolocation tool. Even if you brought back 1000 images from a shooting session so far you'll not have spent more than 10 minutes to do all that. And by now you have all camera settings of every shot lens data like zoom focus aperture etc; date and time shooting location copyrights authorship program used and more. Not bad isn't it? But we could have done more during the importing we could have changed the file names to include the date or place or theme we could have changed the format to a lossless 16 bit per channel format we could have automatically separated JPEG and RAW files into their folders. I actually recommend to auto-rename to match an event a place or a theme. digikam; provides all date/calendar related grouping so that there's hardly a need for coding the date into the file name. Unless you'd like to do just that to browse your albums with another application that is not calendar savvy. You will buy a new camera one day or you have a second one already sooner than you believe. The numbering scheme of that new camera will start over at typically IMG0001.JPG again creating identical file names to the ones you have already if you do not rename them. By renaming you lessen the chance of inadvertently overwriting them at a later date. Keep the new names clean use alphanumerics dashes underscores and a single period prior to the file extension.
I also recommend to switch-on the 'save metadata' options in the digikam; settings page for metadata. This will ensure that EXIF and IPTC data is written into the file. If you forgot to do that you can always catch up by copying the metadata in the database to the files in one go (from the Album menu).
Now we have a lot of stuff already in our database but what if I need to change some of it? digikam; provides a metadata editor for a selected number of attributes the most important ones of course.
SSDs are mechanically more robust than HDDs and suffer much less on that front when they are plugged into the computer. But since they are mostly mobile devices their exposure to drops accidents and electrostatic discharges is much higher. So for different reasons SDDs are as likely to fail if not more than hard drives. Add the danger of theft and longevity and limited capacity and SDDs will become prohibitive as permanent data storage devices.
One major cause for data loss (often recoverable) is the unsafe removal of SDDs from a computer. Before data is saved from a computer memory to any attached device it remains for some time in buffers. In hard drives this means seconds at most whereas with SDDs it can be tens of minutes. Therefore before you disconnect a flash device always activate data flushing through software (often called "safely remove device").
There is a new technology trend coming up to replace hard drives with SSD flash drives. By 2010 they may be competitive in price to HDDs. Data retention is an issue with SDDs it cannot be overwritten an infinite amount of times. SDDs wear in use. Wear then depends much on the location data is written and how often it is written. Linux; has developed a special driver avoiding writing to the same spot too often. But this is all premature information. Keep your eyes and ears open.
Magnetic media
Magnetic tapes are used in backup systems much more in professional environments than in home use. Tapes have issues with data retention and changing technology but they are safer in one aspect than CDs and DVDs they are less exposed to scratches and dirt and writing deficiencies. On the other hand they are susceptible to magnetic fields. Throw a magnet next to a tape and it's gone! Tapes should be re-copied every 5-8 years otherwise too many bits will fail and escape the checksum protection. The downside of magnetic tapes is often the recorder price and the restore time (20x longer than from HDD). Tape backup system have seen their best days.
Best practice Data protection
Use surge protectors (UL 1449 standard) possibly combined with a UPS
use ECC memory to verify correct data transmission (even just saving files)
watch your hard drives (temperature noise) make backups
Keep backups at another location locked up use web storage space
You can also view your images in a slideshow using the Slideshow drop down menu from the Main Toolbar. You have the choice to start a slideshow with a selection of photographs the whole content of the folder (or search result) or even including all subfolders.
Editing a Photograph
You can open the Image Editor on a photograph either clicking the Image Editor button on the Main Toolbar or by selecting  F4 ItemOpen  from the menu bar or clicking with the RMB; and selecting Open from the context menu. See the digikam; Image Editor section for instructions on how to edit your photographs. The Image Editor offers a wide range of tools to enhance decorate and/or modify your photographs.
Viewing or Editing a Photograph With Another Application
Sometimes digikam; may not provide all of the capabilities you need. You can open a photograph in another application by clicking with the RMB; on it and selecting from the Open With sub-menu (At the moment this function is available only under Linux;). The list of applications that appear in this menu is controlled by the standard desktop file associations for the image format type of this photograph. Consult the desktop manual for instructions on changing these file associations if the application that you need is not listed.
Advanced Search tool provides an extended search form which can be used to search in specific fields of the digikam; database in a more sophisticated way. Click the Advanced Search button and it will come up like this
The field labeled Find pictures that have associated all these words is just a duplicate of the Quick Search field.
Click on one of the blue categories and there will fold out an area with all the fields you can search for in that very category. Depending on the kind of data each field contains different input fields for your search sometimes more than one type for the same field. Simplest are selection buttons eg; for colors. Then you have plain fields of the The field content contains type drop down lists and checkboxes. Many fields have two input fields allowing you to define a range eg; Find pictures with a width between. And often you find a link type thing called Any which opens a drop down field with checkboxes for the possible contents of that field.
Advanced Search Criteria
Thanks to the labeling of the search fields they are pretty much self explaining. What we have to talk about is how they work together if you fill in or select more than one. On the right side of the header (blue area at the top) you find a little link Options. If you click on that one the header will change and you see four options.

What is Makernote
The EXIF standard defines a Makernote tag which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format metadata in the file. This is used increasingly by camera manufacturers to store a myriad of camera settings not listed in the EXIF standard such as shooting modes post-processing settings serial number focusing modes etc; but this tag format is proprietary and manufacturer specific.
How to Use Makernote Viewer
Next you specify whether a kphotoalbum; export file should be generated and put on the overview page. See  for details on export files. And if you want to have movies included in-line or as downloadable objects.
Finally you may specify which information should be generated on the HTML; pages. This way you may skip generating information which might be obvious to the reader of the pages (say these images was from the party we all attended). Notice kphotoalbum; does currently not allow you to exclude certain categories from the export file so don't rely on this as a way of excluding information you do not want readers of your pages to see.
The Layout page
On the layout page you specify what your HTML; pages should look like. Most of the options on this page are straight forward and do not need further description here. A short intro to each theme is shown when you select the theme to give some idea what it should look like.

Annotating multiple items at a time
If you have several images with say the same person then it might be more convenient to select those images and specify that this person is on all images using the Annotate Multiple Items at a Time.
If you want to annotate a stack of images you can do that when the stack is collapsed. You just need to select the top image of the stack and annotate multiple images. (If you annotate single image only the selected image the stack head in this case is being annotated.) Of course expanding the stack and selecting all images works as well.
Las Vegas San Francisco Los Angeles and California are all located in USA. Furthermore San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.
Instead of specifying for each and every image from San Francisco that it is in San Francisco and in California and in USA you may instead tell kphotoalbum; that San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California and that California among others are in USA. Doing so the browser (see ) will offer you an item for USA and an item for California in addition to all your normal items. Selecting California you will see all images from San Francisco Los Angeles etc;

KXStitch 2.0
cross stitch pattern creator and editor by kde;
kxstitch file
Let's stick with the Linux; kernel and device driver example mdash; you may want to substitute your own set of libraries or projects for these two examples. To create a new session that contains these two projects go to the SessionStart new session menu at the top left (or if this is the first time you use kdevelop; simply use the default session you get on first use which is empty).
We next want to populate this session with projects that for the moment we assume already exist somewhere (the case of starting projects from scratch is discussed elsewhere in this manual). For this there are essentially two methods depending on whether the project already is somewhere on your hard drive or whether it needs to be downloaded from a server.
Option 1 Importing a project from a version control system server
Let's first assume that the project we want to set up mdash; the Linux; kernel mdash; resides in some version control system on a server but that you haven't checked it out to your local hard drive yet. In this case go to the Project menu to create the Linux; kernel as a project inside the current session and then follow these steps
Go to ProjectFetch Project to import a project
To see the list of all uses of a name through which these commands cycle place the cursor onto it and open the Code Browser tool view or press and hold the Alt; button. This is explained in more detail in the section on Exploring code.
The context list Web browsers have this feature where you can go backward and forward in the list of most recently visited web pages. kdevelop; has the same kind of features except that instead of web pages you visit contexts. A context is the current location of the cursor and you change it by navigating away from it using anything but cursor commands mdash; for example by clicking on a location provided by a tooltip in the Code Browser tool view one of the options given in the Navigation menu or any other navigation command. Using the NavigationPrevious Visited Context (MetaLeft) and NavigationNext Visited Context (MetaRight) transports you along this list of visited contexts just like the back and forward buttons of a browser transports you to the previous or next webpage in the list of visited pages.
Finally there are tool views that allow you to navigate to different places in your code base. For example the Classes tool provides you with a list of all namespaces and classes in all projects of the current session and allows you to expand it to see member functions and variables of each of these classes               Double-clicking on an item (or going through the context menu using the right mouse button) allows you to jump to the location of the declaration of the item. Other tools allow similar things; for example the Projects tool view provides a list of files that are part of a session               Again double-clicking on a file opens it.
Writing source code
Because kdevelop; understands your projects' source code it can assist in writing more code. The following outlines some of the ways in which it does that.
From the FileNew from Template assistant you can also download additional file templates by clicking the Get more Templates button. This opens a Get Hot New Stuff dialog where you can install additional templates as well as update or remove them. There is also a configuration module for templates which can be reached by clicking SettingsConfigure kdevelop;Templates. From there you can manage both file templates (explained above) and project templates (used for creating new projects).
Of course if none of the available template suit your project you can always create new ones. The easiest way is probably to copy and modify an existing template while a short tutorial and a longer specification document are there to help you. To copy an installed template open the template manager by clicking SettingsConfigure KDevelopTemplates select the template you wish to copy then click the Extract Template button. Select a destination folder then click OK and the contents of the template will be extracted into the selected folder. Now you can edit the template by opening the extracted files and modifying them. After you are done you can import your new template into kdevelop; by opening the template manager activating the appropriate tab (either Project Templates or File Templates) and clicking Load Template. Open the template description file which is the one with the suffix either .kdevtemplate or .desktop. kdevelop; will compress the files into a template archive and import the template.
When copying an existing template make sure you rename it before importing it again. Otherwise you will either overwrite the old template or will end up with two templates with identical names. To rename a template rename the description file to something unique (but keep the suffix) and change the Name entry in the description file.
If you want to write a template from scratch you can start with a sample C++ class template by creating a new project and selecting the C++ Class Template project in category KDevelop.

Check here if you want konversation; to automatically connect to this network whenever you open konversation;.
This is a list of irc; Servers in the network. When connecting to the network konversation; will attempt to connect to the top server first. If this fails it will attempt the second server. If this fails it will attempt the third and so on. At least one server must be specified. Click a server to highlight it.
Use these buttons to Add a server Edit a highlighted server or Delete a highlighted server. You can also adjust the order of the server list and therefore the order of connection attempts.
Optional. This is a list of the channels that will be automatically joined once konversation; has connected to a server. You may leave this blank if you wish to not automatically join any channels.
Use these buttons to Add a channel Edit a highlighted channel or Delete a highlighted channel. You may also change the order the channels are joined.
The information known about the i18n-nickname; is displayed here. When the Watched Nicks screen is first displayed this information is sparse. Every 20 seconds one WHOIS command is automatically sent to the server to request information for i18n-nickname;s that do not have any information. This continues until all i18n-nickname;s have information.
To add a single i18n-nickname; to watch open the context menu in the Nick List by clicking with the RMB; on a i18n-nickname; and select Add to Watched Nicks. If you want to add several i18n-nickname;s choose  Settings Configure Konversation  from the main menu expand Notifications and click on Watched Nicknames. The Watched Nicknames screen appears.
Check this box to activate the i18n-nickname; watcher feature.
If you want the Watched Nicks screen to automatically display when you open konversation; check this box.
The Watched Nicks feature works by periodically polling the server. This box sets how often that occurs. Avoid numbers less than 20 seconds because it places excessive load on the server.
To view the logfile for a session click the tab for the session to make it the current session and choose  Window Open Logfile  from the main menu. A new tab appears displaying the log file.
Click this button to save the log file to another file.
Click to refresh the log file display. While you are viewing a log file newer messages in the corresponding session are not automatically added to the log file display. Use this button to view the most recent messages.
Click to erase the log file display and the log file on disk.
Use this box to set the maximum size of the scroll. This setting does take effect only for newly opened log tabs. The last changed value of the scroll size will be used on konversation;'s next start. Each log file may have a separate setting.
To be able to run a script you have written you must install it by copying it to $(qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation)/konversation/scripts. You must also give the file execute privilege for example chmod a+x myscript.
Script Reference Guide
konversation; comes with several scripts installed by default please refer to this guide to learn how to use them.
/exec  bug [Bug Number|Search String]
This script is used to open your browser to search for the given string or bug number on kde;'s Bugzilla.
konversation; won't connect to any servers. What is wrong?
There are several things that could be wrong.
Make sure that you have entered the correct Server name and the correct Port in the Add Server screen.
Check the output in the Server Messages screen for any error messages. Did the server reject the connection because of a bad password? Did the server reject the connection because it requires IDENTD and your computer did not respond to the IDENT request? Did you check the SSL protocol box but the server does not support SSL?
If you are behind a firewall make sure the correct ports are enabled. konversation; needs the following ports enabled
Abort any running process of the network neighborhood browser. This action is invisible by default and will only be visible instead of the Scan Network|Workgroup|Computer action when a network scan is running.
Ctrl; F Search
Search the network neighborhood for a specified search term. Activating this action opens the search toolbar where you can enter the search term and start the search.
Ctrl; B Add Bookmark
Add a bookmark to the currently selected remote share. This action is disabled if no share is selected.
Tooltips are enabled by default. You can deactivate them in the configuration dialog.
Inaccessible Shares
smb4k; periodically checks all mounted shares if they are still accessible. If an inaccessible share is encountered it will be marked with a locked folder icon and you will not be able to open or synchronize it anymore. Unmounting and adding a bookmark is still possible.
The program might freeze for a short period of time due to an inaccessible share. It will recover afterwards.
Three different icons may be presented to the user
Profiles can be managed via the configuration dialog.
Configuration Tab
To configure the behavior of smb4k; you can launch the configuration dialog on the Configuration page.

appname; has some additional configuration options that are not visible in the Configuration Dialog. They are not important enough to warrant cluttering the dialog with more settings but as they represent options which may appeal to various users the application does read them from the configuration file.
Exporting Bibtex
When exporting to Bibtex the field values may be escaped with braces or quotation marks. If any string macros are used in the collection they may optionally be exported as macros or expanded. For URL; fields appname; may enclose the field values with the \url{} tag. Finally entries with no citation key may be skipped rather than have appname; auto-generate the key.
Bibtex Export Options
Exporting GCstar
GCstar is another movie collection manager. appname; is able to export most collection types to a GCstar data file.
ktimetracker; makes tracking time simple. To start logging time against a task double-click on the task. To stop logging time double-click the task again. Active tasks display a small clock in the Session Time column.
Another visual clue of logging activity is the ktimetracker; system tray icon. When a task is active the second hand in the icon moves. If you rest the mouse pointer over this icon the name of the active task will display in a tooltip. If more than one task is active the task names in the tooltip are separated by commas.
ktimetracker; maintains two timers for each task one for the session time and one for the total time. In the default configuration ktimetracker; displays two columns for each timer resulting in a total of four columns for each task
The time spent on the task since the session began.
The time spent on the task since all times were reset.
QString addTask(QString taskname)
taskname
The name of new task.
addTask(QString taskname) is a DBus; call that adds a new top-level to-do to the current storage. The UID of the new task is returned.

This tab allow to configure the basic credentials of a SIP account. The default resolve account checkbox is used to know if that account have priority when performing contact information lookup.
The settings in the basic tab are often present in other tab in more advanced details. The credential tab allow to configure chained credentials this feature is rarely used and you should avoid using them unless you really need to.
Chained credentials
It is also possible to enable Secure SIP in the security dialog. Most accounts are used in an intranet or using a VPN so they are not secured. But if your account is the Security dialog is here for you.
Account security
Central store of data. That may be a database or a flat filesystem. Without special clients you're not able to read data in it. For Subversion repositories kdesvn; is such a client.
A flat copy of a repository on local filesystem. This is used like any normal filemanager editing files and so forth. RCS-information you can read with clients like kdesvn;.
Remember that subversion does not know anything about KIO so a working copy must reside in an area where it may reached without any specific protocol eg; fish// or such is not possible.
WebDav
WebDav is a protocol which let you modify files on a remote webserver. Subversion is a special kind of WebDAV when repositories are accessed via webserver. In normal use this is read-only. With special configurations you may get a read-write enabled WebDAV which you may access via specialized browser. kdesvn; is NOT a webdav-client but konqueror; is via the webdav// protocol. But with kdesvn; you may browse through the version tree of a repository (via http//)
Now all numbers like #190 will parsed and translated to an URL; in log output.
Two expressions
Keep care of white spaces after the (\d+)! This is one of the most common errors causing these expressions do not match!
On local opened repositories (ie; file// protocol) and on working copies these properties will searched upward from opened folder until found or the subversion top level is reached. On repositories opened via network (all except file// protocol) it is only searched on opened folder itself.
Support for multiple sets of these properties may follow later (eg; in subfolder extra values for other tracker etc;) but in most cases evaluating single tracker links should be enough.
loggedcopyfrompath
If copied from which path? (may be empty)
loggedcopyfromrevision
If copied at which revision? (may be lt; 0)
loggedpath
When a password is not stored persistent kdesvn; may hold it until kdesvn; ends so you may not need to enter it again for each operation. This cache is never persistent ie; it will not be saved anywhere.
If checked log follows copy operations.
The log command may read list of changed files in commit. This is useful and in most cases it cost not real more traffic.
When doing a commit kdesvn; may make a check what to do. For example if unversioned items are below which may be added list items changed and current operation will commit. This cost a depending on tree more or less time.
Check modified items every N seconds
Subversion Working copy Ignore/Unignore current item
Edit property of parent folder of the current item so that selected item will be marked as ignored if not set otherwise remove it from ignore list.

Now it is time to copy the home partition from the old device to the extended partition on the new device. Select the old device in the Device List panel click on partition sdb5 and pick .
Then go back to the new device and click the extended partition. Select . The following dialog will come up
Pasting the home partition
This already looks mostly okay but you already know that you will not need that much free space after the home partition because you will later create a swap partition there.
So grab the right resize handle in the dialog's resizer widget and move it to the right until the free space after the pasted partition has a size more suitable for a swap partition
Not all file systems for example support setting a label. It is also generally not possible to modify any properties if the partition is mounted.
This is a list of all partition and file system properties that can in general be modified in this dialog
Set or modify a file system's label
Change the partition's file system.
Changing the file system for a partition always means that all data on the partition is destroyed.
If one file is the same and one file is different on a line then the color shows which file is different. The red color means that both other files are different.
Comfortable Merge Of Two Or Three Input Files
kdiff3; can be used to merge two or three input files and automatically merges as much as possible. The result is presented in an editable window where most conflicts can be solved with a single mouseclick Select the respective  buttons at the A/ B/C windows to select the source that should be used. You can also select more than one source. Since this output window is an editor even conflicts which need further corrections can be solved here without requiring another tool.
Fast navigation via buttons.
A mouse-click into a summary column sync's all windows to show the same position.
The just-insert-all-entries-method is easier to configure. kdiff3; just needs a method to detect which lines belong to one history entry. Most VCS insert an empty line after each history entry. If there are no other empty lines this is a sufficient criterion for kdiff3;. Just set an empty History entry start regular expression at Merge item in the settings dialog. If the empty line criterion isn't sufficient you can specify a regular expression to detect the history entry start.
Note that kdiff3; will remove duplicate history entries. If a history entry appeared several times in the history of a input file only one entry will remain in the output.
If you want to sort the history then you have to specify how the sort key should be built. Use parentheses in the History entry start regular expression at Merge item in the settings dialog to group parts of the regular expression that should later be used for the sort key. Then specify the History entry start sort key order option specifying a comma "" separated list of numbers referring to the position of the group in the regular expression.
Because this is not so easy to get right immediately you are able to test and improve the regular expressions and key-generation in a dedicated dialog by pressing the Test your regular expressions button.
Example Assume a history that looks like this
Some languages are written right to left. When this option is enabled kdiff3; draws the text from right to left in the diff input windows and in the merge output window. Note that if you start kdiff3; with the command line option --reverse then all layouting will be done right to left too. (This is a feature provided by Qt;.)
This documentation was written assuming that this option or reverse layout are disabled. So some references to "left" or "right" must be replaced by their respective counterpart if you use these options.
(These options and actions are available in menus or the buttonbar.)
Overview options
These choices are only available when you compare three files. In normal mode all differences are shown in one color-coded overview-column. But sometimes you are especially interested in the differences between only two of these three files. Selecting "A vs. B" "A vs. C" or "B vs. C"-overview will show a second overview column with the required information next to the normal overview.
When the directory scan is complete then kdiff3; will show a listbox with the results left
and details about the currently selected item on the right
The Name Column
Each file and directory that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. You can select an item by clicking it with the mouse once.
The directories are collapsed by default. You can expand and collapse them by clicking on the "+"/"-" or by double-clicking the item or by using the Left;/Right; cursor keys. The Directory menu also contains two actions Fold All Subdirs and Unfold All Subdirs with which you can collapse or expand all directories at once.
If a file or complete directory is replaced by another or is deleted then the original version will be renamed with an .orig extension. If an old backup file with .orig extension already exists then this will be deleted without backup. This also affects the normal merging of single files not only in directory-merge mode. Default is on.
Other Functions in Directory Merge Window
Split/Full Screen Mode
Usually the directory merge list view remains visible while a single file is compared or merged. With the mouse you can move the splitter bar that separates the file list from the text-diff windows. If you don't want this you can disable DirectoryDir amp;amp; Text Split Screen View menu item. Then you can use DirectoryToggle View menu item to switch between the file list and the text-diff view that then occupy the full screen.

Pressing Enter; on a selected file opens the file with the associated application. The editor-viewer is tabbed configure it on the Konfigurator General page
To view a file as fast as possible according to its type just put it under the cursor and press F3. krusader;'s internal viewer is actually a part of konqueror; which can basically view every file type viewable by konqueror; (eg; display pictures play music show the content of an archive). This is called the 'Generic viewer' for which you need to configure the MIME; types.
The viewer works as follows   It tries to view the file with the 'Generic viewer'.   When the file type (MIME; type) cannot be determined or when a file (eg; a binary) does not have an associated action it disables the 'generic viewer'. The file is treated as a text file which is the 'Text viewer'.   The user can change in the KrViewer menu between 'Generic viewer' (if available) 'Text viewer' and 'Hex viewer'.  You can configure the default viewer mode on the Konfigurator General page .
Shift; F3 views a URL; on demand eg;
 man/ views the manpages.
kappname; will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text.
Cursor amp; Selection
Wrap cursor
When on moving the insertion cursor using the Left; and Right; keys will go on to previous/next line at beginning/end of the line similar to most editors.
When off the insertion cursor cannot be moved left of the line start but it can be moved off the line end which can be very handy for programmers. When this option is chosen moving the cursor with the arrow keys off the end of a line (to the right) causes it to jump down to the beginning of the next line. Likewise when the cursor is moved past the beginning of a line (to the left) it jumps up to the end of the preceding line. When this option is not selected moving the cursor right past the end of a line merely causes it to continue horizontally in the same line and trying to move it left past the beginning does nothing.

kgendesignerplugin OPTIONS file
The custom widget plugins for Qt; Designer usually follow a standard pattern and the classes provided by the plugin mostly provide static information along with function to create an instance that is normally just a simple constructor call. kgendesignerplugin allows developers of libraries that provide new widgets to create such a plugin without creating all the associated boilerplate code by providing a simple ini-style description file.
kgendesignerplugin chooses sensible defaults for most settings so minimal configuration is usually necessary.

An IRQ is a hardware line used in a PC by (ISA bus) devices like keyboards modems sound cards etc; to send interrupt signals to the processor to tell it that the device is ready to send or accept data. Unfortunately there are only sixteen IRQ's (0-15) available in the i386 (PC) architecture for sharing among the various ISA devices.
Many hardware problems are the result of IRQ conflicts when two devices try to use the same IRQ or software is misconfigured to use a different IRQ from the one a device is actually configured for.
The exact information displayed is system-dependent. On some systems IRQ information cannot be displayed yet.
On Linux; this information is read from /proc/interrupts which is only available if the /proc pseudo-filesystem is compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the IRQ number. The second column is the number of interrupts that have been received since the last reboot. The third column shows the type of interrupt. The fourth identifies the device assigned to that interrupt.

Loci
kig; supports the use of loci. A locus is mathematically defined as the set of all points or lines that satisfy or are determined by specific conditions; as in the locus of points equidistant from a given point is a circle. Let's look at an example of how to use loci in kig;
Consider the following geometrical construction We draw a circle and a point that can move only along its circumference (construct this point by positioning the cursor on a circle and clicking the MMB;. If you then try to move the resulting point you'll see that you cannot move it off the circle). Then we draw a segment from that point to the center of the circle and the midpoint of that segment.

Plotting derivatives and integral functions.
These features help in learning the relationship between mathematical functions and their graphical representation in a coordinate system.
First Steps With kmplot;
Simple Function Plot
name(var1[ var2])=term [;extensions]
The function name. If the first character is r the parser assumes that you are using polar coordinates. If the first character is x (for instance xfunc) the parser expects a second function with a leading y (here yfunc) to define the function in parametric form.
var1
The function's variable
var2
Note the precedence which means that if parentheses are not used exponentiation is performed before multiplication/division which is performed before addition/subtraction. So 1+2*4^2 returns 33 and not say 144. To override this use parentheses. To use the above example ((1+2)*4)^2 will return 144.
Plotting Area
By default explicitly given functions are plotted for the whole of the visible part of the horizontal axis. You can specify an other range in the edit-dialog for the function. If the plotting area contains the resulting point it is connected to the last drawn point by a line.
Parametric and polar functions have a default plotting range of 0 to 2pgr;. This plotting range can also be changed in the Functions sidebar.

The next important thing is to focus one's attention on accuracy. Only if you mastered the use of the currently unlocked keys which means you make only very few errors with them still you will have chance in the following lessons with even more keys to handle. You will notice you become almost automatically master if you make only very little errors and you will save precious time if you don't have to correct that many errors.
Correcting mistakes
If you made mistakes it's important to correct them efficiently. Correcting single characters is almost always slower than correcting the whole word. For the latter you have just to press Ctrl;Backspace; and retype the word. The mental overhead for this is very small. For the first you have to first locate the your mistake delete precisely to the location of the error determine the missing part of the word re-type it. This requires way more concentration when retyping the whole word.

parley; is a vocabulary trainer. It helps you to memorize your vocabulary for example when you are trying to learn a foreign language. You can create your own vocabulary collections with the words you need or select from a great variety of available Vocabulary Collections. There you can find collections containing language vocabulary and also anatomy music geography chemistry or exam preparation.
parley; is very flexible and uses the flash card learning approach. It automatically keeps track of your learning progress. With parley; you can arrange your vocabulary as you wish you create your own lessons as needed. But unlike real flash cards you can use different learning methods with parley;.
Flashcards contain expressions on the front side and their translation on the back. You start with a pile of cards. If you know the translation on a card you can put it into a second pile of cards. If you did not remember it you keep it in the first one to try again later.
parley;'s main focus is not to teach you grammar. However there are some exercise forms which may help you in this matter.
Comparison Forms of Adjectives and Adverbs
On the Practice screen select Comparison Forms and then click on Start Practice to go ahead.
This only works when the conjugation forms of the word have been entered in the vocabulary collection. See Entering Comparison Forms.
The exercise requires you to enter the comparison forms for the term shown. In this case the translation of the English word old to German. The German language has three forms absolute comparative and superlative. To go on with the exercise just click on Continue.
To practice conjugations choose the Conjugations mode and the tenses you wish to exercise.

Now Lesson 1 is highlighted and you can simply overwrite it by typing in Animals. When done hit the Enter; key. Now right-click on Collection Vocabulary trainer E which is the root of the unit tree and choose New Unit from the options shown. In the new field write Fruits and hit the Enter; key again.
First let's insert the animals. Please click on the unit Animals and you will get an empty table you can fill in. Click with your mouse in the first field and insert the source terms. Then insert the target terms in the second column. Once you've inserted all 4 English animal names with their German translation the screen looks like this
In our case we want only 4 entries in the animals unit. There are many empty lines that should be deleted. To do this click on the first empty field and keep the Shift; key pressed while clicking on the last empty field. All lines to be deleted will be highlighted. Then press the Del key.
Execute the Algorithm
The algorithm can be executed by the Run button at the script control panel.
The rocs; User Interface
Main Elements of the User Interface
The user interface is divided into several logical parts as presented at the screenshot below.
graph.step
Plots velocity vs. position graph for particle1 in the system of two particles connected with a spring.
liquid.step
This example simulates monoatomic liquid.
lissajous.step
katomic; main screen
Reassemble molecules from compound atoms by sliding them around.
katomic; will load level one once you start the game and you can begin playing right away. To see how the molecule you are supposed to make looks like take a look at the upper right corner. To play click on an atom. You will see green arrows pointing in the directions where atom can move. To move the atom click on the desired arrow. When an atom starts moving it will not stop until it hits another atom or a wall so make sure you think before you do your next move. You can assemble your molecule wherever you like on the game board but some places are easier to access than others. When the molecule is assembled you can move to the next level.

A chessboard consists of 64 equal squares arranged in eight rows and eight columns. The squares are arranged in two alternating colors white and black. Many different materials are used to make chessboards so the lighter colored material is known as white and the darker material is known as black.
Parts of the board are known by special names
Rank - the eight horizontal rows of the chess board are called ranks.
File - the eight vertical columns of the chess board are called files.
What is gwenview;
gwenview; is a fast and easy to use image and video viewer.
gwenview; features two main modes Browse and View. Both modes can be used in a normal application window and Full Screen. Browse Mode lets you navigate through your computer showing thumbnails of your images View Mode lets you view images one at a time and Full Screen lets you make quick slideshows. There is also a start screen that displays a list of recently opened folders and URL;s as well as your places and tags.
Image loading is handled by the Qt; library so gwenview; supports all image formats your Qt; installation supports. gwenview; correctly displays images with an alpha channel (transparency) as well as animations.
gwenview; supports the displaying and editing of EXIF comments in JPEG images. Lossless JPEG transforms such as rotations and mirroring are also supported.
F4 Show or hide the Sidebar.
F6 Make the Location bar editable so that you can directly type in a file path. You can return to the standard Location Bar by pressing the arrow at the right.
Ctrl;R Rotate the current image to the right.
Ctrl;L Rotate the current image to the left.
Shift;R Resize the current image.
         Line (L)
         Pen (P)
         Polygon (G)
         Rectangle (R)
         Rounded Rectangle (U)
This reduces the entire image or selection to black and white.
If you do not want the image or selection to be dithered use the  Reduce Colors dialog.
Resizing the image changes the dimensions of the image without applying a transformation to the existing contents. Scaling the image will stretch the existing contents to the new dimensions. Smooth Scale generally provides better quality results than Scaling by blending neighbouring colors.
You can express the new dimensions in pixels or as a percentage of the original size. If you select Keep aspect ratio the width and height will be scaled by the same percentage.
You can free-form Resize the entire image or Smooth Scale the selection using the corresponding handles.
Some documents have links. In this case you can click on them and the view will change to the page it links to. If the link is to a web page or some other document the default kde; handler for that format will be invoked. For example clicking on a link pointing to http//www.kde.org will open the web page in the default kde;'s web browser.
The document internal links work only when Browse Tool is used.
Additionally you may use the following functionality to quickly move to specific places in the document
You can go to the beginning of the document using Ctrl;Home or using  Go Beginning of the document .
You can go to the end of the document using Ctrl;End or using  Go End of the document .
If you click with the LMB; on an annotation it gets selected. Resize handles appear on the selection rectangle. When the cursor is moved over one of the 8 resize handles on the corners or edges the cursor shape changes to indicate the resize mode. Click anywhere else on the annotation to move it. Pressing Esc; or clicking an area outside the annotation cancels a selection.
Resizing is only applicable for annotation types Inline Note Typewriter Stamp and Ellipse.
Depending on the document permissions (typically with PDF; documents) some options can be disabled.
Bookmark Management
okular; has a very flexible bookmark system. okular; saves the position on the page in bookmark and allows you to define more than one bookmark per page.
The trim margins mode is persistent across okular; restarts. The trim to selection mode is forgotten across okular; restarts.
When you switch okular; from trim margins mode to trim to selection mode the view jumps out of trim margins mode for the bounding box selection interaction.
The trim mode can be deactivated by selecting the same menu item that activates it once again.
View Show/Hide Forms
Show or hides the display of the form fields of the document.
Inverts colors on the view ie; black objects will be shown white.
Changes the paper's color ie; the document's background.
Change Dark amp; Light Colors
Changes the dark and light color to your preference that means black will not be rendered as black but as the selected dark color and white will not be rendered as white but as the selected light color.
Convert to Black amp; White
Once spectacle; starts you will see a window like the following
spectacle; Main Window
spectacle; grabs an image of your entire desktop immediately after it is started but before it displays itself on screen. This allows you to quickly create full-desktop screenshot images.
The snapshot taken by spectacle; is displayed in the preview window which is located on the left-hand side of the spectacle; application window.
The image can be saved to a location of your choice by clicking on the Save As button or typing Ctrl;Shift;S. This opens the standard save dialog where you can choose the filename the folder location and the format that your screenshot will be saved in. You may edit the filename to anything you wish including the name of a previously saved screenshot.

Add Selected Items to Audio or Data CD
This allows you to quickly create a K3b CD;-burning project from your selected songs. juk; will ask you if you would like an Audio CD; project or a Data CD; project unless K3b already has a project open.
If K3b is not already running juk; will start it up for you. After that juk; will add your selected files to the current K3b project. You can then save the project in K3b for burning later or burn the CD; right away.
juk; Playlists
A playlist is simply a collection of songs grouped by some category. For example you may have a playlist of songs that you listen to while coding while trying to sleep or even when you need a laugh. juk; supports several different types of playlists.

The Submit Tab
The Submit tab
The Submit tab sets up connection to a mail server or a web server to submit new CDDB entries. This is useful if you do not have your own system configured as a server.
If you plan to submit a CDDB entry enter your email address into the first textbox then you must decide between submitting between HTTP; and submitting the entry as an email (via SMTP;).
It is simpler to submit new entries using HTTP;. Some firewalls block this traffic. If your firewall prevents you from sending new entries using HTTP; you can use SMTP;.
Adding clips
Project Bin Adding video clips
Now that the project is ready let’s start adding some clips (ie; the ones you downloaded). This works via the Project Bin widget; a click on the Add Clip icon      directly opens the file dialog a click on the small arrow shows a list of additional clip types that can be added as well. Video clips audio clips images and other kdenlive; projects can be added via the default Add Clip dialog.
Kdenlive window with the tutorial files
After loading the clips kdenlive; will look similar to this. On the top left there is the already known project tree. Right of it are the monitors that show video; The clip monitor displays video from the original clips the project monitor shows how the output video will look with all effects transitions etc; applied. The third also very important item is the timeline (below the monitors) This is the place where the video clips will be edited. There are two different types of tracks Video and Audio. Video tracks can contain any kind of clip audio tracks as well – but when dropping a video file to the audio track only the audio will be used.
Configure general kmix; parameters.
Behavior Volume Feedback
Check this box to enable audible feedback on volume change.
Behavior Volume Overdrive
Check this box to allow volume to be more than recommended value (sometimes PulseAudio maximal volume exceeds the normal value). kmix; restart is needed for this setting to take effect.
Samples can be stored in different formats and precisions. The most common ones are integer (fixed-point) formats that store values with fixed quantisations. Depending on where the zero line is defined it has to be destinguished between unsigned (only positive values "zero line" is at half of the numeric range) and signed (positive and negative values) integer formats.
Signed Format
Unsigned Format
As the quantisation loses some accuracy it produces noise the so-called quantisation noise. That kind of noise has more effect on low amplitudes so this method of storing samples is not optimal but quite easy and very fast to handle (computers are fast in calculating with fixed point numbers).
The second way of encoding samples is with floating point numbers. With floating point numbers noise is spread nearly equal over all ranges of amplitudes and has advantages especially on low amplitudes. However this format is much slower when used for processing (computers are much slower on calculating with floating point values in comparison to fixed point numbers).
The playback settings dialog also provides a button for playing a simple test sound. You should hear a 440Hz tone that wanders over all speakers from one to the next.
Once you have configured playback you can use the playback controls of the kwave; main window or through the Play menu or with keyboard shortcuts
 P PlayStart  Start playback of the current selection from its beginning or the whole file from the current cursor position if nothing was selected. Play only once.
 PlayLoop  Like before but repeat in a loop.
 Space; PlayPause  Pause the playback at the current position. Only available when the playback is running.

It contains a list of devices separated between paired and unpaired. Select one to pair it and when it's paired configure it.
Device Configuration
bzip2 is a compression program.
The bzip2 kioslave is not directly usable and is intended for use as a filter. For example the tar kioslave can filter a file through the bzip2 kioslave in order to display the contents of a tar.bz2 file directly in a konqueror; window.
If you click on a file compressed with a .bz2 in konqueror; this kioslave is used to uncompress it and display it as a normal (uncompressed) file.
If you are a developer and would like to use the bzip2 filter you can find documentation on using kioslaves at http//techbase.kde.org
See the manual bzip2.
Introduction to Instant Messaging
What is Instant Messaging (im;)? im; is a way for you to communicate instantly with your friends over the Internet. That might not sound so different to email. Have you ever noticed how cumbersome it is to have a brief conversation via email? You have to click Reply to each message then find the right spot in the message to type something new then send it. Then you have to wait for the next message to arrive! im; lets you to have a conversation almost as naturally as on the phone or face to face by typing messages into a window shared between you and your friend's screens.
Another difference between im; and email is that with im; you can see your friends' presence that is whether they are actually on-line at the same time as you. This lets you send messages truly instantly instead of sending off a mail and having to wait for your friend to check their mailbox. An im; message pops up on the other person's screen as soon as you send it. Of course if you'd rather not be interrupted you can change your own presence so others will know not to disturb you.
There are lots of other fun and useful im; features you can explore with kopete; like group chats file transfers and emoticons that reflect your mood. Read on to find out more!
To use kopete; you need to set up one or more accounts for the instant messaging services you wish to use.
Someone typed a message.
Someone is typing a message.
Someone typed a message containing your nickname.
There are several different ways to control grouping. To configure this behavior go to the Chat tab of the Behavior page of the Configure kopete; dialog. You can also move chats between windows using the Tabs menu and control the placement of the tabs in the window.
Group Chats in kopete;
GroupWise Messenger is an enterprise messenging system from Novell Inc. The full range of features are supported including privacy group chat rich text and user search.
Gadu-Gadu is a chat system originating from Poland. At present kopete; supports basic chat functions.
WinPopup is a way to use kopete; to send and receive messages with Windows; computers on the local network. The WinPopup protocol only supports single plain-text messages.
Other protocols
As well as the protocols named above kopete; has support for several other protocols. In most cases this is not enabled by default or an additional plugin must be installed. Meanwhile SMS Skype and SILC are provided in this way. However the kopete; team are not responsible for these protocols.

This means you have modified the file compared to the version in the repository.
This means the file does not exist in the repository but in your working copy and you have scheduled it for addition. The actual insertion into the repository only happens after a commit.
This means you have scheduled the file for removal but it still exists in the repository. The actual removal happens only after a commit.
This is shown if a newer version of the file exists in the repository eg; because someone committed a modification. Normally you want to update this file so you have an up-to-date version in your folder.
This is essentially the same as before; the difference is that in case of an update the CVS; server transfers only a patch instead of the whole file to you.
Create patches containing the differences between any pair of versions of the marked file including pairs with the current working copy version of the marked file.
A screenshot of cervisia;'s browse logs dialog
You can choose to see the history as provided by the cvs log command (CVS Output) as a Tree or in List form. What you prefer is of course a matter of taste and it depends on what information you are interested in. The tree is an intuitive representation of what has been done on different branches by which authors. As tooltips you can see the corresponding log messages. The list is by its nature linear and therefore does not give an immediate view of branches; on the other hand it concentrates more otherwise relevant information on less screen estate namely the time of each change of the file and the first part of the log message. The CVS; output information is complete but long and difficult to read. To alleviate these problems you have the ability to search the text of the CVS; output by pressing the Find button.
To obtain more information about a certain revision you can click on it either in the list or the tree view. The fields in the middle of the dialog are then filled with the complete information provided by cvs log. You can mark two revisions called Aand B which are relevant if you make use of further features provided by the buttons. Revision Acan be chosen with the left mouse button revision B with the middle one. In the list view you can also navigate with your cursor keys. In order to mark revisions Aand B use the shortcuts Ctrl;A Ctrl;B respectively. Using the CVS Output view you can click on the Select for revision A and Select for revision B to mark the revisions.
If you press the Annotate button you get a dialog showing the text of file belonging to the revision marked as A. Every line is prefixed with the information about who edited this last time and at which revision this happened. You can get more information about viewing annotated versions in .
Here you can set the name (or path) to the cvs command line client. By default the CVS; executable found in your $PATH is used by cervisia;.
Number of context lines in the diff dialog
For the diff dialog cervisia; uses the option -U to diff. This lets diff show only a limited number of lines around each difference region (context lines). Here you can set the argument to -U.
Here you can add additional arguments to the diff. A popular example is -b which lets diff ignore changes in the amount of whitespace.
In the diff dialog tab characters present in your file or in the output of the diff command are expanded into a fixed number of space characters. By default each tab is replaced by eight spaces but here you can setup a different number.

kompare; provides a menu driven interface. Explanation to the menu items and their options is provided in .
The kompare; toolbar provides shortcuts to the most frequently used diff and merge operations. The toolbar orientation text positioning icon size properties and which shortcut icons are displayed can be customized from the toolbar context menu accessed when right-clicking the toolbar with the mouse. The toolbar context menu also enables the toolbar to be hidden. If the toolbar is hidden and you wish to unhide it select SettingsShow Toolbar.
kompare; Diff Settings
The command used to run the diff program (default diff).
kompare; Format Settings
Adjust options for the Output Format and number of Lines of Context.
The context output format adds several lines of context around the lines that differ.
It is recommended that you get used to the keyboard shortcuts instead of the menus and toolbars for increased productivity. For example use the Ctrl;L to focus Quick search input line to filter the unit list in Translation Units view. Once you are done press Page Down to start moving along the filtered list.
If you are working with translation files in XLIFF format (definitely the case when you translate OpenDocument) then extended states are available (new needs review approved etc;). You may select them in drop-down menu of Approved button in the toolbar. Classification of the state as ready or not ready depends on the current workflow phase (translation review approval). A default phase for you depends on your role in the project (set in project settings). Each unit usually contains information about phase it was changed last time and for each phase its owner is logged to the file.
General Notes
The projects are one of the main concepts in lokalize;. A project is represented by a file that contains paths folders with translations templates and other files glossary file automation scripts translation memories. Whenever lokalize; opens a file without a project loaded it will search for a project file in the parent folders (up to four levels). Alternatively you can specify the project file via the --project flag when starting lokalize; from the command line.
For each project you select your role in it (translator reviewer approver) which in turn affects the workflow phase lokalize; automatically picks up for files you edit.
One of the following variables (but not both) should be set if the source directory is different from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a subdirectory of the source directory the simpler variable OBJSUBDIR should be used.
OBJSUBJDIR
Indicates that the build directory is in the given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance if the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux then OBJSUBDIR should be set to obj-i386-linux.
OBJREPLACEMENT
A sed expression that is used to transform the source directory into the build directory. For instance if the source directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux then OBJREPLACEMENT should be set to s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.
Note that this tool does not remove anything; it simply prints what to do as a series of remove commands. You can copy and paste these commands or use them with eval in a script.
This tool works better if the source directory is not the same as the build directory since it will not print directories containing old executables.
Actually perform the deletions instead of just printing them out. Use this option with care.

UML; Basics
About UML;
This chapter will give you a quick overview of the basics of UML;. Keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive tutorial on UML; but rather a brief introduction to UML; which can be read as a UML; tutorial. If you would like to learn more about the Unified Modelling Language or in general about software analysis and design refer to one of the many books available on the topic. There are also a lot of tutorials on the Internet which you can take as a starting point.
Activity Diagrams are similar to procedural Flux Diagrams with the difference that all Activities are clearly attached to Objects.
Activity Diagrams are always associated to a Class an Operation or a Use Case.
Activity Diagrams support sequential as well as parallel Activities. Parallel execution is represented via Fork/Wait icons and for the Activities running in parallel it is not important the order in which they are carried out (they can be executed at the same time or one after the other)
An Activity is a single step in a process. One Activity is one state in the system with internal activity and at least one outgoing transition. Activities can also have more than one outgoing transition if they have different conditions.
Activities can form hierarchies this means that an Activity can be composed of several detail Activities in which case the incoming and outgoing transitions should match the incoming and outgoing transitions of the detail diagram.
You can delete any element by selecting the option Delete from its context menu.
Again there is a big difference between removing an object from a diagram and deleting an object from your model If you delete an object from within a diagram you are only removing the object from that particular diagram the element will still be part of your model and if there are other diagrams using the same element they will not suffer any change. If on the other hand you delete the element from the Tree View you are actually deleting the element from your model. Since the element no longer exist in your model it will be automatically removed from all the diagrams it appears in.
Editing Elements
You can edit most of the UML; elements in your model and diagrams by opening its Properties dialog and selecting the appropriate options. To edit the properties of an object select Properties from its context menu (RMB; click). Each element has a dialog consisting of several pages where you can configure the options corresponding to that element. For some elements like actors you can only set a couple of options like the object name and documentation while for other elements like classes you can edit its attributes and operations select what you want to be shown in the diagram (whole operation signature or just operation names etc) and even the colors you want to use for the line and fill of the class' representation on the diagram.
For UML; elements you can also open the properties dialog by double clicking on it if you are using the selection tool (arrow).
Here's a screenshot of kbackup;
Using profiles
To keep a selection for later use simply save it into a kbackup; profile file. Use the File menu and select Save Profile.
To reload a selection into kbackup; use the File Load Profile menu item.
kbackup; saves in a profile the selections for all included folders/files excluded folders/files the target folder/URL; defined archive prefix the defined maximum slice file size etc;

Signing keys
When you sign a key of someone else (let's call her Alice) you announce that you are sure that this key really belongs to that person and the key can be trusted. Of course you really should have checked that. This usually means that you have to meet Alice check at least one identity card and get the full key fingerprint or a copy of her key. Then you go home and sign that key. Usually you will later upload the newly signed key to a key server so everyone knows you have checked that key and the owner may be trusted. Alice will likely do the same so you both will have your keys signed by the other one. If one of you has no identity card at hand it's no problem if the signing happens in only direction.
But think about what happens if Alice lives on the other end of the world. You communicate with her regularly but there is no chance you will see her anytime soon. How do you trust her key?
When you select her key and then choose Sign Key you will get the dialog that allows you to choose the options how you would like to sign that key.

EditDelete Address Book
Delete the current address book. Be careful with this command -- you could lose some data! In theory this function simply removes the symbolic link between kaddressbook; and the associated vCard file or directory (or the hyperlink to a cloud-based service) and the real data will not be altered. Still it's probably wisest to make a backup copy of this address book somewhere before you delete it.

kaddressbook;'s Import CSV File dialog after choosing the FileImportnbsp; nbsp;gt;Import CSV file function and selecting the file to be imported.
Use the Delimiter section of this dialog to specify which separator character defines the end of a field in the chosen input file. If quote marks are used to delimit fields with embedded separator characters you may specify the style (single or double quote) used via the Text quote drop-down box. If the input file contains dates use the Date format field to define the way dates have been encoded. The default is yyyy-mm-dd. If that's the wrong format hover your cursor over the Date format box and a handy set of formatting instructions will be displayed. If the input file is not UTF-8 encoded use the Text codec drop-down box to specify the binary encoding scheme to use. If the first row of the file contains column headers check the Skip first row of file box to avoid importing the column headers as data. Use the Undefined boxes at the top of each column to specify which data fields are to be imported and where they should be stored as shown below.

See the next section for a list of the pre-defined fields. Use the horizontal scrollbar near the bottom of the dialog to view all the columns in the input file. When your selections are complete click the nbsp;✔nbsp;OKnbsp; button. If you have defined multiple address books you will be asked to specify which address book is to be used. kaddressbook; will then import the selected data as new contacts.
Searching is performed as follows
Text message alarms the message text is searched.
File display alarms the file path/URL; is searched.
Command alarms the command line or command script is searched.
Email alarms in addition to the subject and body of the email the recipients and the URLs of attachments are searched.
Export all the alarms in the selected calendar to an external calendar file. This is described in Exporting Alarms to External Calendars. This option is not available for disabled calendars.
Display details about the selected calendar. This shows the calendar's location storage type and status information.
Use as Default
Make the selected calendar the default calendar for the selected calendar type. This option is not available for disabled or read-only calendars.
Select a background color for highlighting this calendar's alarms in the alarm list. This enables you to see at a glance which alarms belong to a particular calendar.
Reminders are not displayed for sub-repetitions within a recurrence. Reminders are only shown for each main recurrence of the alarm.
If the alarm recurs check Reminder for first recurrence only if you only want a reminder for the alarm's first recurrence. If this is checked and it is an advance reminder the reminder period is not subject to the normal limit of being less than the recurrence or sub-repetition interval.
Cancelation
The late-cancelation options determine how an alarm is treated after its scheduled time
The Cancel if late check box determines what happens if the alarm cannot be triggered at its scheduled time.
Alarms may be individually enabled and disabled independently of the alarm monitoring status. So the enabled/disabled status of individual alarms will be unchanged by disabling and then re-enabling alarm monitoring. Unlike alarm monitoring which could potentially be disabled due to kalarm; not running individual alarms can only be disabled if you use menu commands to do so.
When an alarm is individually re-enabled it is not now triggered if it became due while disabled. In other words disabling an individual alarm cancels all its occurrences until it is re-enabled.
An alarm's individual enabled/disabled status is indicated by its color in the alarm list (the color being configurable in the View tab of the Configuration dialog).
For an alarm to trigger it must be individually enabled as well as alarm monitoring being enabled.
Enabling Alarm Monitoring
The Edit section lets you choose default values for the options in the Alarm Edit dialog
The General tab contains options which apply to all alarm types.
Set the default states for the Show in KOrganizer and Cancel if late check boxes.

Creates a new key pair (public and private) and allows to send the public part to a certification authority (ca;) for signing. The resulting certificate is then sent back to you or stored in an ldap; server for you to download into your local keybox where you can use it to sign and decrypt mails.
This mode of operation is called decentralized key generation since all keys are created locally. kleopatra; (and gpgsm;) do not support centralized key generation directly but you can import the public/secret key bundle that you receive from the ca; in PKCS#12 format via .
Ctrl;Shift;I FileLookup Certificates on Server
Searches for and imports certificates from certificate servers into the local keybox. See  for details.
You need to have key servers configured for this to work. See  for more details.
Naturally this function is only available if you selected at least one certificate.

ToolsGnuPG Log Viewer
Although dn;s are hierarchical the order of the individual components (called relative dn;s (RDNs) or dn; attributes) is not defined. The order in which the attributes are shown is thus a matter of personal taste or company policy which is why it is configurable in kleopatra;.
This setting does not only apply to kleopatra; but to all applications using kleopatra; Technology. At the time of this writing these include kmail; kaddressbook; as well as kleopatra; itself of course.
This configuration page basically consists of two lists one for the known attributes (Available attributes) and one describing the Current attribute order.
Both lists contain entries described by the short form of the attribute (eg; CN) as well as the spelled-out form (Common Name).
The Available attributes list is always sorted alphabetically while the Current attribute order list's order reflects the configured dn; attribute order the first attribute in the list is also the one displayed first.
kleopatra; allows you to customize the fields that the user is allowed to enter in order to create their certificate.
Create a group called CertificateCreationWizard in the system-wide kleopatrarc. If you want a custom order of attributes or if you only want certain items to appear create a key called DNAttributeOrder. The argument is one or more of CNSNGNLTOUOPCCSPDCBCEMAIL If you want to initialize fields with a certain value write something like Attribute=value. If you want the attribute to be treated as a required one append an exclamation mark (e.g. CN!LOUO!C!EMAIL! which happens to be the default configuration).
Using the KIOSK mode modifier $e allows to retrieve the values from environment variables or from an evaluated script or binary. If you want to disallow editing of the respective field in addition use the modifier $i. If you want to disallow the use Insert My Address button set ShowSetWhoAmI to false.
Due to the nature of the kde; KIOSK framework using the immutable flag ($i) makes it impossible for the user to override the flag. This is intended behavior. $i and $e can be used with all other config keys in kde; applications as well.
The following example outlines possible customizations
There are three ways to pass filenames to the pack command. For each of these pack-command provides a particular syntax
As command-line arguments.
pack-command=zip -r -
Via standard-in separated by newlines prepend |.
Example (GNU;-tar) pack-command=|gtar cf - -T- Example (ZIP) pack-command=|zip -@ - In this case filenames are passed to the archiver on stdin one per line. This avoids problems on platforms which place a low limit on the number of command line arguments that are allowed but fails when filenames in fact contain newlines.
Identity Templates
Here you can create and manage templates to use when composing new messages replies or forwarded messages.
The message templates support substitution commands either simply type them or select them from the Insert Command menu.
Identity Signature
This tab allows you to specify a signature (sometimes called footer or disclaimer) to be appended to each message sent using this identity.
Once you have made all of your autocorrect selections click the Apply button.
In some circumstances you may need to have kmail; automatically resize image attachments on outgoing emails. eg; Mail server limits. To do so select Automatically resize images. There are several options that come with this feature.
Some general options for auto image resizing are as follows If you need your images to keep the ratio of length and width intact eg; Photographs select Keep ratio. The default behavior is for kmail; to prompt and ask if you want to resize before resizing if you want it to resize without asking unselect Ask before resizing. kmail; will save the file in JPG if you would rather have them save in PNG format select it from the Write to format drop down box.
Say you have a relative that can only receive image files of a certain size due to their email providers limits you can use the Reduce image to maximum dimension option to select a size to reduce the image to and enter their email into the filters on the Recipients tab. The recipients tab is discussed in further detail at the end of this section. If you need a custom size choose the last option Custom from the width and height drop down boxes and enter the number in the text box. You can also enlarge images by selecting Enlarge image to minimum dimension. The last option allows you to skip images of a certain filesize (this will verify image size by width x height only).
If you would like the resizing to be done based on the name of the file you would select the appropriate filter here. eg; You need to send your boss multiple images daily and your boss requires them to be the same size. You could name all of your work images work1 work2 etc; then select Include all files whose names contains one of the patterns and enter work into the Pattern text box. You can also exclude files in the same way by selecting Exclude all files whose names contains one of the patterns. The default behavior is no filtering.
If Jump to Newest Message is selected then kmail; will select the newest message by date.
If Jump to Oldest Message is selected then kmail; will select the oldest message by date.
When you select a new or unread message kmail; will change the message's status to read after the number of seconds entered here. If you disable this option messages will keep their new or unread status.
When you drag a message to a different folder a small popup will ask you if you want to move or copy the message. If you disable this option the message will be moved immediately without a popup.
Here you can set the folder that should be selected by default if you start kmail;. If you use only imap; folders then you might want to set this to your imap; inbox folder. If you do that you can collapse the local folders in the folder list and then they will stay collapsed when kmail; starts.

Can I use kmail; together with a different email client eg; mutt?
If you're using the mbox format for your folders it is not possible to use a different email client while kmail; is running. With mutt there may also be problems even if both programs are not running at the same time. We recommend to use the maildir format in this case this should solve all problems.
How can I convert my mailboxes from mbox to maildir?
There is no automatic way to do that. You will have to create a new folder in maildir format and copy the messages from the mbox folder into this new folder. Remember to adapt any filter rules connected with the old folder before you delete it.
How can I remove attachments from messages without removing the message itself?
This is a short introduction to kmail; and its usage so you can start working with it right away. For more in-depth information see the Using kmail; section.
The first time you run kmail; you will be greeted with the Account Wizard.
If at anytime you need to run the account wizard again you can find it under SettingsAdd Account.
The wizard will take you through the process of creating your email accounts. Your screens will vary depending on how much the wizard can determine on its own. Below is an outline of the screens you may encounter while using this wizard.
Provide personal data is the first screen of the wizard. It will prompt you for your basic account information Full name E-mail address and Password. By default the Find provider settings on the Internet option is checked the wizard will attempt to retrieve the necessary information from the server. Uncheck this option if you are an expert user and you need to set up advanced configuration. Click the Next button once finished.
File Check Mail In
Check for new messages from a particular account these accounts will be listed in the submenu.
 F5  File Update Folder

If this does not work try workaround 2 (below).
Workaround 2
This one is mostly a matter of restarting so kmail; can fetch those pesky items Some possible steps
Use Alt;F2 or konsole; to type kquitapp kmail then wait a minute then akonadictl stop wait a minute type akonadictl start wait a minute type kmail. This stops kmail; (closing all windows) stops the kmail; backend starts the kmail; backend starts kmail;. Having a working internet connection increases the chances of success. Sometimes you can also just do kquitapp kmail wait a minute and start kmail; again. Often a few restarts seem to be needed. It is unclear what is the reason for this but on bad network connections it is more likely to happen.
S/MIME;
This format is an alternative format to OpenPGP/MIME;. If you use this format then the message text and all attachments will be signed and/or encrypted (at least by default). This format is mostly used by corporations.

If you are going to use the folder for a mailing list open the Mailinglist Folder Properties dialog with Folder Mailing List Management  from the menu. Then you should check Folder holds a mailing list to associate this folder with the mailing list. Next you should click on Detect Automatically. kmail; will then try to guess some information about the mailing list from the currently selected message. If kmail; could not determine some addresses then you can add the missing information manually. To do this first select the Address type for which you want to add an address. You can choose between
This address is used for sending messages to the mailing list. This is usually an email address.
This address is used for subscribing to the mailing list. This can be an email address or the address of a web page.
This will feed the message to a program if the program returns output the entire message (including the headers) will be replaced with this output; if the program does not return output or exits with a return code other than 0 (indicating an error occurred) the message will not change. Specify the full path to the program. The same substitutions (percnt;n percnt;{foo} as with execute command are performed on the command line.
Be cautious with this action as it will easily mess up your messages if the filter program returns garbage or extra lines.
Will remove all header fields with the given name from the message. This is useful mainly for removing bogus Reply-To headers.
If no such field is already present this will add a new header field with the given name and value to the message; if there already is a header field with that name it is overwritten with the given value; if there are already multiple headers with the given name (eg; Received headers) an arbitrary one of them is overwritten and the others are left unchanged -- this is a known limitation. You may want to combine this filter with the remove header filter above to make sure that there are no other headers with that name in the message.
Will scan the given header field modify its contents and write it back. The search string is always interpreted as a case-sensitive regular expression. The replacement string is inserted literally except for occurrences of \n $n and ${nn} where n is a positive (single-digit except for the third form) number or 0. These constructs are interpreted as back references to substrings captured with parentheses in the search string.
Now you are able to sign outgoing messages; to let people send you encrypted messages and to let them verify your signature you must send them your public key or upload your public key to a public GnuPG key server so that they can fetch your key from there. To send encrypted messages to other people or to verify their signed messages you will need their public keys; you can store your public key(s) on a public GnuPG key server.
Sign your Messages
You can compose your message as usual in the composer window of kmail;. Before you send the message check the Sign icon on the toolbar of the composer window; then you can send the message. The identity you are using to write the current message needs to be connected to an OpenPGP Key in the Identity section of the Configure dialog. To sign the message kmail; needs to know your GnuPG passphrase if you did not select Keep passphrase in memory in the Security section kmail; will ask you for it; otherwise if you have already given the phrase to kmail; it will sign the message without any further prompt.
Encrypt your Messages
To send an encrypted message to somebody whose public key you have you simply create the message in the composer window. Before you send the message check the Encrypt button in the toolbar of the composer window; note that you might not have to check the button if Automatically encrypt messages whenever possible is selected in kmail;'s configuration (see above). Then send the message.
Sending a note
To send a note to an other computer select Send in the context menu of the note titlebar. Add a hostname or ip or choose a recipient from the list of previously sent notes. If the recipients has enabled incoming notes the note will appear on his screen indicating the sender id in the titlebar.
Locking a note
To prevent accidental changes in a note select Lock in the context menu of the note titlebar.
Saving a note
Note konsolekalendar; needs the file to work so never delete the file by hand.
Technical sidenote konsolekalendar; creates with this command a new Akonadi resource pointing to this file. It does not prevent you to create multiple resources pointing to the same file.
Create a new calendar from an existing file named vacation.ics
The resource will be named vacation using --list-calendars
It is not possible to delete an Akonadi resource with konsolekalendar; you have to use korganizer; or akonadiconsole.
What configuration files does konsolekalendar; use?
What are the application names of konsolekalendar;?
konsolekalendar;'s application name is konsolekalendar.
What is the date specification format?
konsolekalendar; will reject dates specified on the command line unless they are specified according to ISO 8601 standards namely YYYY-MM-DD. Where YYYY represents a four-digit year (like 2003) MM represents a two-digit month (0102..12) and DD represents a two-digit day (010231).

Hover your mouse over any calendar item to display a tooltip with the item details. Double click an empty area to create an event double click any calendar item to edit it.
To help you organize your data the color of the events may reflect their category and its resource depending on the korganizer; view configuration. Therefore if you assign categories to events and different colors to categories you can identify the type of event (or resource) by its color.
Switch the display to the Month view by choosing the View Month View menu item or pressing the Month button in the toolbar.
The Timeline view shows all events for the selected timespan in a gantt view. Every calendar is displayed in a separate line.
The To-do List provides a place for you to jot down quick (or long-term) notes about things that need to be done. The To-do View sidebar component appears right below the Date Navigator. You can also display it in the main panel if you click the   To-do List view toolbar button or if you choose the ViewTo-do List menu item.

The group schedule functionality of korganizer; allows you to organize appointments meetings and shared to-do items request responses from attendees and publish items. If you are being invited to an event or to-do you can reply to it stating if you will be able to attend or send a counter proposal with different arrangements like a different time or location. You can also publish your free/busy schedule to let people know when you are available and request the same information from others.
Currently korganizer; schedules events and to-dos using email to transport the data in a standards based scheme the IMIP-protocol for group scheduling. Being a standard IMIP is a used by many other clients too. For example Microsoft;Outlook Lotus Notes and Novell Evolution. This means that you can share events with other users using one of these clients. korganizer; is integrated with kmail; for receiving processing and sending events event responses updates cancellations etc; For instance when you get an invitation in kmail; and decide to accept it by clicking the accept link in the mail body the event is added to your calendar and a response to the event's organizer is sent automatically.
If you check the Use Groupware Communication box in the korganizer; group scheduling configuration korganizer; will handle the group scheduling communication for you. In other words you will seldom need to use the Schedule menu directly to perform the scheduling actions. For instance if you create an event or to-do with attendees korganizer; will ask you if you want to send the invitations to the attendees so you will not need to use the  ScheduleSend Invitation to Attendees  menu item later. Also if you change your status as an attendee for an event you were invited to it will ask you if you want to send your updated status to the event's organizer so you will not need to use the  ScheduleSend Status Update  menu item later.

$[officename] Basic knows one- or multi-dimensional arrays defined by a specified variable type. Arrays are suitable for editing lists and tables in programs. Individual elements of an array can be addressed through a numeric index.
Arrays must be declared with the Dim statement. There are several ways to define the index range of an array
The index range can include positive as well as negative numbers.
Constants have a fixed value. They are only defined once in the program and cannot be redefined later
Using Objects
Select Properties from the context menu of a breakpoint or select Breakpoints from the context menu of the breakpoint column to call the Breakpoints dialog where you can specify other breakpoint options.
The list displays all breakpoints with the corresponding line number in the source code. You can activate or deactivate a selected breakpoint by checking or clearing the Active box.
The Pass Count specifies the number of times the breakpoint can be passed over before the program is interrupted. If you enter 0 (default setting) the program is always interrupted as soon as a breakpoint is encountered.
Click Delete to remove the breakpoint from the program.
Observing the Value of Variables
Opens the Macro Organizer dialog.
Watch Window
The Watch window allows you to observe the value of variables during the execution of a program. Define the variable in the Watch text box. Click on Enable Watch to add the variable to the list box and to display its values.
Enter the name of the variable whose value is to be monitored.
Removes the selected variable from the list of watched variables.
Select "Yes" to prevent the user from editing the value of the current control. The control is enabled and can be focused but not modified.
Repeats trigger events when you keep the mouse button pressed on a control such as a spin button.
Specifies if the root node of the tree control is displayed.
If Root displayed is set to FALSE the root node of a model is no longer a valid node for the tree control and can't be used with any method of XTreeControl.
The default value is TRUE.
Positive numeric expressions are printed with a leading space. Negative expressions are printed with a leading minus sign. If a certain range is exceeded for floating-point values the respective numeric expression is printed in exponential notation.
If the expression to be printed exceeds a certain length the display will automatically wrap to the next line.

These spreadsheet functions are used for inserting and editing dates and times. 
The functions whose names end with ADD or EXCEL2003 return the same results as the corresponding Microsoft Excel 2003 functions without the suffix. Use the functions without suffix to get results based on international standards.
$[officename] internally handles a date/time value as a numerical value. If you assign the numbering format "Number" to a date or time value it is converted to a number. For example 01/01/2000 1200 PM converts to 36526.5. The value preceding the decimal point corresponds to the date; the value following the decimal point corresponds to the time. If you do not want to see this type of numerical date or time representation change the number format (date or time) accordingly. To do this select the cell containing the date or time value call its context menu and select Format Cells. The Numbers tab page contains the functions for defining the number format.

The predefined default list entry is entered into the Default selection combo box.
Note that the list entries entered here are only incorporated into the form if on the Data tab under List Content Type the option "Value List" is selected.
If you do not want the list entries to be written to the database or transmitted to the recipient of the Web form but rather assigned values that are not visible in the form you can assign the list entries to other values in a value list. The value list is determined on the Data tab. Under Type of List Contents select the option "Value List". Then enter the values under List Contents that are to be assigned to the corresponding visible list entries of the form. For the correct assignment the order in the value list is relevant.
With the "Valuelist" option all entries entered in the List entries field of the General tab appear in the control. For database forms you can use reference values (see the References Using Value Lists section).
If the content of the control is read from a database you can determine the type of the data source with the other options. For example you can choose between tables and queries.
In the case of database forms the data source determines the entries of the list or combo box. Depending on the selected type you have a choice between different data sources under List content provided that these objects exist in your database.

Signing other document formats is not supported at the moment.
When you load an ODF document you might see an icon in the status bar and the status field in the dialog that indicates that the document is only partially signed. This status will appear when the signature and certificate are valid but they were created with a version of OpenOffice.org before 3.2 or StarOffice before 9.2. In versions of OpenOffice.org before 3.0 or StarOffice before 9.0 the document signature was applied to the main contents pictures and embedded objects only and some contents like macros were not signed. In OpenOffice.org 3.0 and StarOffice 9.0 the document signature was applied to most content including macros. However the mimetype and the content of the META-INF folder were not signed. And in OpenOffice.org 3.2 StarOffice 9.2 and all versions of LibreOffice all contents except the signature file itself (META-INF/documentsignatures.xml) are signed.
When you receive a signed document and the software reports that the signature is valid this does not mean that you can be absolutely sure that the document is the same that the sender has sent. Signing documents with software certificates is not a perfectly secure method. Numerous ways are possible to circumvent the security features.
Example Think about someone who wants to camouflage his identity to be a sender from your bank. He can easily get a certificate using a false name then send you any signed e-mail pretending he is working for your bank. You will get that e-mail and the e-mail or the document within has the "valid signed" icon.
Do not trust the icon. Inspect and verify the certificates.
Inserting controls in a text form
When you create a text form linked to a database you can generate controls by drag-and-drop from the data source view.
When you drag a database column into the text document you insert a field. If you hold down Shift+CommandCtrl while dragging a text field is inserted grouped with an appropriate label field. The text field already contains all the database information that you need for the form.

It should be easily possible to install ${PRODUCTNAME} on other Linux distributions not specifically covered in these installation instructions. The main aspect for which differences might be encountered is desktop integration.
The RPMS (or DEBS respectively) directory also contains a package named libreoffice${PRODUCTVERSION}-freedesktop-menus-${PRODUCTVERSION}.0.1-1.noarch.rpm (or libreoffice${PRODUCTVERSION}-debian-menus${PRODUCTVERSION}.0.1-1all.deb respectively or similar). This is a package for all Linux distributions that support the Freedesktop.org specifications/recommendations (https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedesktop.org) and is provided for installation on other Linux distributions not covered in the aforementioned instructions.
Installing a Language Pack
Download the language pack for your desired language and platform. They are available from the same location as the main installation archive. From the Nautilus file manager extract the downloaded archive into a directory (your desktop for instance). Ensure that you have exited all ${PRODUCTNAME} applications (including the QuickStarter if it is started).
Change directory to the directory in which you extracted your downloaded language pack.

Using the Main Menubar
This chapter describes how to use the MATE Panel Menubar.
In spatial mode each open Caja windows shows only one location. Selecting a second location will open a second Caja window. Because each location remembers the previous position on screen in which it was opened it allows you to easily recognize folders when many of them are open at once.
Some people consider spatial mode better particularly for moving files or folders to different location others find the number of open windows daunting.  shows an example of spatial browsing with many open locations.
Because spatial mode will fill your screen with Caja windows it is important to be able to reposition them effectively. By holding the Alt key and clicking anywhere within the bounds of a Caja window you may reposition it simply instead of requiring that you reposition it by dragging its title bar.

Directories and File Systems
In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems the filesystem is organised in a hierarchical tree-like structure. The highest level of the filesystem is the / or root directory. These operating systems create a virtual file system in which a filesystem object such as a file or a directory is represented by an inode. Each inode stores information about its parent and children as well as its own attributes among others the owner the permissions the last change access or modification of the filesystem object.
For example /home/jebediah/cheeses.odt shows the correct full path to the cheeses.odt file that exists in the jebediah directory which is under the home directory which in turn is under the root (/) directory.
Underneath the root (/) directory there is a set of important directories or symbolic links to directories

Forces the translations for the language code to be used (e.g.  'deDE' for the German translations). Entering 'list' as the code will cause the program to output a list of available translations.
--abort-on-warnings
Tells the program to abort after the first warning is emitted. The program's exit code will be 1.
--debug topic
Turn on debugging for a specific feature. This option is only useful for developers.
ATRUEHD AMLP
These will be extracted to raw TrueHD/MLP files.
ATTA1
TrueAudio tracks are written to TTA files. Please note that due to matroska;'s limited timestamp precision the extracted file's header will be different regarding two fields datalength (the total number of samples in the file) and the CRC.
AVORBIS
Write to the file file-name.  If splitting is used then this parameter is treated a bit differently.  See the explanation for the --split option for details.
-w --webm
Create a WebM compliant file. This is also turned on if the output file name's extension is quot;webmquot;. This mode enforces several restrictions. The only allowed codecs are VP8 VP9 video and Opus Vorbis audio tracks. The DocType header item is changed to quot;webmquot;.
For chapters and tags only a subset of elements are allowed. mkvmerge; will automatically remove all elements not allowed by the specification.
Sets the general title for the output file e.g. the movie name.
If an end timestamp is left out then it defaults to the end of the source files which basically tells mkvmerge; to keep the rest (see example 3).
Normally each range will be written to a new file. This can be changed so that consecutive ranges are written to the same file. For that the user has to prefix the start timestamp with a +. This tells mkvmerge; not to create a new file and instead append the range to the same file the previous range was written to. Timestamps will be adjusted so that there will be no gap in the output file even if there was a gap in the two ranges in the input file.
In example 1 mkvmerge; will create two files. The first will contain the content starting from 000120 until 000245. The second file will contain the content starting from 000550 until 001030.
In example 2 mkvmerge; will create only one file. This file will contain both the content starting from 000120 until 000245 and the content starting from 000550 until 001030.
In example 3 mkvmerge; will create two files. The first will contain the content from the start of the source files until 000245. The second file will contain the content starting from 000550 until the end of the source files.
-M --no-attachments
Don't copy attachments from this file.
--no-global-tags
Don't copy global tags from this file.
Sets the charset that is used for the conversion to UTF-8 for chapter information contained in the source file. See the section about text files and character sets for an explanation how mkvmerge; converts between character sets.
--projection-pose-pitch TIDfloat
--projection-pose-roll TIDfloat
--field-order TIDn
Sets the field order for the video track with the track ID TID.  The order must be one of the following numbers
0 progressive; 1 interlaced with top field displayed first and top field stored first; 2 undetermined field order; 6 interlaced with bottom field displayed first and bottom field stored first; 9 interlaced with bottom field displayed first and top field stored first; 14 interlaced with top field displayed first and bottom field stored first
AVI files The video track has the ID 0. The audio tracks get IDs in ascending order starting at 1.
AAC AC-3 MP3 SRT and WAV files The one 'track' in that file gets the ID 0.
Most other files The track IDs are assigned in order the tracks are found in the file starting at 0.
The options that use the track IDs are the ones whose description contains 'TID'.  The following options use track IDs as well --audio-tracks --video-tracks --subtitle-tracks --button-tracks and --track-tags.
Special track IDs
$ mkvmerge  --timestamps 0mytimestamps.txt v1.avi +v2.avi
There are four formats that are recognized by mkvmerge;. The first line always contains the version number. Empty lines lines containing only whitespace and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
Timestamp file format v1
This format starts with the version line. The second line declares the default number of frames per second.  All following lines contain three numbers separated by commas the start frame (0 is the first frame) the end frame and the number of frames in this range. The FPS is a floating point number with the dot '.' as the decimal point. The ranges can contain gaps for which the default FPS is used. An example
Timestamp file format v2

MX Debian Backports Installer
Greyed out items have already been installed.
= Upgradable package. Newer version available in backports repository.
LimitationsRemember this software is provided AS-IS with no warranty what-so-ever. It's solely your responsibility to backup your data before proceeding.Choose PartitionsMX Linux requires a root partition. The swap partition is optional but highly recommended. If you want to use the Suspend-to-Disk feature of MX Linux you will need a swap partition that is larger than your physical memory size.If you choose a separate /home partition it will be easier for you to upgrade in the future but this will not be possible if you are upgrading from an installation that does not have a separate home partition.UpgradingTo upgrade from an existing Linux installation select the same home partition as before and check the preference to preserve data in /home.If you are preserving an existing /home directory tree located on your root partition the installer will not reformat the root partition. As a result the installation will take much longer than usual.Preferred Filesystem TypeFor MX Linux you may choose to format the partitions as ext2 ext3 ext4 jfs xfs btrfs or reiser. Bad BlocksIf you choose ext2 ext3 or ext4 as the format type you have the option of checking and correcting for bad blocks on the drive. The badblock check is very time consuming so you may want to skip this step unless you suspect that your drive has bad blocks.
Special ThanksThanks to everyone who has chosen to support MX Linux with their time money suggestions work praise ideas promotion and/or encouragement.Without you there would be no MX Linux.MX Dev Team
Installation in ProgressMX Linux is installing.  For a fresh install this will probably take 3-20 minutes depending on the speed of your system and the size of any partitions you are reformatting.If you click the Abort button the installation will be stopped as soon as possible.
Select Boot MethodMX Linux uses the GRUB bootloader to boot MX Linux and MS-Windows. By default GRUB2 is installed in the Master Boot Record or ESP (EFI System Partition for 64-bit UEFI boot systems) of your boot drive and replaces the boot loader you were using before. This is normal.If you choose to install GRUB2 at root instead then GRUB2 will be installed at the beginning of the root partition. This option is for experts only.If you uncheck the Install GRUB box GRUB will not be installed at this time. This option is for experts only.
Common Services to EnableSelect any of these common services that you might need with your system configuration and the services will be started automatically when you start MX Linux.

Mageia 5 includes several desktop managers including KDE Gnome XFCE Mate and Cinnamon.
There's plenty of new goodness in Mageia 5 too much to include here - see the release notes for an extensive exposé.
There is one feature worth mentioning here. It took a lot of effort and time but it was worth it. Mageia 5 supports UEFI which means it’s now even easier to install it on recent hardware.

Double-click the Mixxx icon in the file`Applications` folder. Alternatively drag the Mixxx icon to the dock and double-click it there or search for "Mixxx" in Spotlight.
Simply type command`mixxx` into the terminal then hit kbd`Return`. With some distributions like Ubuntu you can also double-click the Mixxx icon in the launcher. Alternatively perform a search for file`mixxx`.
Mixxx Sound Hardware Preferences
menuselection`Preferences --> Sound Hardware` allows you to select the audio in- and outputs to be used.
**Sound API** Depending your term`Operating System` select the term`API` that Mixxx uses to deliver audio to your audio device. Your choice can drastically affect how smooth Mixxx performs on your computer.
Mixxx comes with a high precision key detection to help you making smooth mixes by ensuring that your tracks are musically compatible.
Key detection is a complex operation. Depending on your computer and the track's bitrate and duration this may take some time. By default Mixxx analyzes the complete track. To accelerate key detection on slower computers a “Fast Analysis” option is available. If enabled the key is computed by analyzing the first minute of the track.
Mixxx preferences - Key settings
The table below summarizes the Key detection settings
If enabled the key will be detected by using only the first minute of audio.

Reverb controls
This is a port of the GPL'ed CAPS Reverb plugin which has the following description This is based on some of the famous Stanford CCRMA reverbs (NRev KipRev) all based on the Chowning/Moorer/Schroeder reverberators which use networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters.
**Bandwidth**
Due to licensing restrictions term`vinyl control` is not available in Mixxx from the Mac App Store.
Installation on GNU/Linux
Official packages of Mixxx are only offered for Ubuntu Linux. However Mixxx can build on almost any Linux distribution.

The Mixxx Library
Overview of the Library features
The library manages all of your music files. This is where you can find the tracks you want to play and load them into a ref`deck ` or ref`sampler `; see ref`djing-loading-tracks`. Mixxx imports your music library automatically when it is run for the first time see ref`djing-import` for more information.

**Import crate** Import tracks from an external playlist to a crate in various file formats.
**Export crate** Export a crate in various file formats such as file`m3u` file`pls` or file`csv`. Ideal for processing the data in other applications.
Crates vs. Playlists
Crates are unordered collections of tracks. Unlike playlists they cannot contain duplicate entries and do not support drag-and-drop within them.
Playlists serve a limited purpose of keeping an ordered list of tracks. You can right-click a playlist to queue it to ref`Auto DJ ` so in a sense you can “play” it.
You may need to configure port forwarding if you are behind a router or your router will block requests to your streaming port (for example port 8000)
Activate MP3 streaming support
Due to licensing restrictions term`MP3` streaming is not enabled by default. In order to enable MP3 streaming you must install the term`LAME` MP3 term`codec` yourself. The following section explains how you can do that.
If you have activated MP3 streaming support you'll be also able to record your mixes in MP3 format. Go to the chapter ref`djing-recording-your-mix` for more information.
Activate MP3 streaming support on Windows
Glossary of Terms
Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a patented audio compression algorithm which uses a form of term`lossy` data compression. Designed to be the successor to term`MP3` AAC generally achieves better sound quality at similar bit rates. While the .AAC extension is sometimes used for AAC-encoded files they are typically saved with an .M4A file extension.
AcoustID
An acoustic fingerprint system built entirely on term`open-source` technology. It aims to create a free database of user-submitted audio fingerprints with mapping to the term`MusicBrainz` term`metadata` database and provide a web service for audio file identification using this database. For more information see``.
Short for Audio Interchange File Format. High-quality digital audio file format similar to .wav files. Contains CD-quality audio stored in a non-compressed term`lossless` format. AIFF files generally end with a .AIFF or .AIF extension.
The speed of a track measured in term`bpm`.
timecode
Used here in conjunction with term`vinyl control`. A special audio signal on a control vinyl or control CD (timecode media) that a computer can listen to in order to determine speed direction and position of the playback.
A track is another word for a song.
Uniform Resource Locator. The address that defines the route to a file on an Internet server. URLs are typed into a Web browser to access Web pages and files and URLs are embedded within the pages themselves as hypertext links. One example of a URL is `` .
The first deck (in numerical order) that has a track loaded with a detected beatgrid no matter if it is playing or stopped.
So basically if you sync a sampler and both deck 1 and deck 2 are playing a track with a beatgrid then deck 1 will win since numerically it is first. The sync targets for decks are chosen with the new master sync feature see ref`master-sync` for more information.
**Pitch/Rate slider**
**Pitch Rate Display**
**Pitch/Rate buttons**
Clicking the Play/Pause button starts and pauses the playback.
The actual behavior of the Play/Pause button depends on the selected ref`Cue mode `.
To return to the beginning of the track right-click on the deck's ref`Fast-Rewind Button `.
Cue Button
If the button is pressed while the track is playing the play position jumps to the term`Cue point ` on the track and the track is paused. Once the track is paused at the Cue point you can preview it by holding the Cue Button. If you have not moved the Cue point yet the default point is at the track's beginning.
Use this knob to adjust the gain of the microphone output. Try to keep the volume at a reasonable level to avoid signal clipping.
Preview Deck Section
The Preview Deck with a track loaded
The Preview Deck is a special deck that allows you to pre-listen to tracks in the headphones before using them in your mix.

To ensure security and privacy RSS feed URLs contain a special token that identifies the user they are for. This prevents other users from accessing areas of the site where they are not allowed.The token is automatically created the first time you access an area that produces an RSS feed. If you think that your RSS feed token has been compromised you can request a new one by clicking the reset link. Please note that your current RSS feed URLs will then become invalid.

Down payment (fixed amount)
Down payment (percentage)
Down payments are made when creating invoices from a sales order. They are not copied when duplicating a sales order.
From this report you can have an overview of the amount invoiced to your customer. The search tool can also be used to personalise your Invoices reports and so match this analysis to your needs.
The margin is computed as the sum of product sales prices minus the cost set in their detail form.
The product used to invoice a down payment should be of type 'Service'. Please use another product or update this product.
The product used to invoice a down payment should have an invoice policy set to "Ordered quantities". Please update your deposit product to be able to create a deposit invoice.
The value of the down payment amount must be positive.
There are currently no orders for your account.

By changing this quantity here you accept the new quantity as complete Odoo will not automatically generate a back order.
By default the system will take from the stock in the source location and passively wait for availability. The other possibility allows you to directly create a procurement on the source location (and thus ignore its current stock) to gather products. If we want to chain moves and have this one to wait for the previous this second option should be chosen.

Who Created ScratchJr?
ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies (DevTech) Research Group at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development at Tufts University (led by Marina Umaschi Bers with contributions from Amanda Strawhacker Claire Caine Louise Flannery Elizabeth Kazakoff and Dylan Portelance) the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab (led by Mitchel Resnick with contributions from Chris Garrity Tim Mickel Carl Bowman Champika Fernando Natalie Rusk Sayamindu Dasgupta and Chris Graves) and the Playful Invention Company (led by Paula Bontaacute; and Brian Silverman with contributions from Jack Geddes and Adrian Gabriel). The Android version of ScratchJr was implemented by Two Sigma (led by Mark Roth with contributions from Kevin Hu) with input from Benesse Corp. The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr were created by HvingtQuatre Company (led by Julien Gelifier and Adrien Valesa) Sarah Thomson Peter Mueller and Jillian Lombardi. Paula Aguilera of the MIT Media Lab produced the ScratchJr video. We would also like to thank everyone who participated in the beta-test communities for iPad and Android particularly Sergio Antolinez Vandendaele Didier and Sjoerd Dirk Meijer.
Who Supported ScratchJr?
The ScratchJr project has received generous financial support from the National Science Foundation (NSF DRL-1118664) Scratch Foundation LEGO Foundation and British Telecommunications.If you enjoy using this free app please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation (www.scratchfoundation.org) a nonprofit organization that provides ongoing support for ScratchJr. We appreciate donations of all sizes large and small.

Triggering Blocks
After selecting the Rotate tool you can rotate a character or shape around its center.
After selecting the Drag tool you can drag a character or shape on the canvas. If you tap on a shape you can then edit the shape by dragging the dots that appear.
Save changes and leave the Paint Editor.
After selecting the Fill tool you can tap any section of a character or shape to fill it with the currently selected color.
After selecting the Camera tool you can tap any section of a character or shape and then tap the camera button to fill the section with a new photo taken with the camera.
By snapping together graphical programming blocks children can make characters move jump dance and sing. In the process children learn to solve problems design projects and express themselves creatively on the computer. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr children don’t just learn to code they code to learn.
ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http//scratch.mit.edu) used by millions of people (ages 8 and up) around the world. The ScratchJr interface and programming language were redesigned to make them appropriate for younger children’s cognitive personal social and emotional development.

Current Sponsors
The following organizations are providing major financial support for Scratch
Do I have to download an app to use Scratch?
No. You can also use the Scratch project editor in any web browser on any device by going to scratch.mit.edu and clicking "Create".
Can I use Scratch Link to connect to extensions?
Yes. However you will need an Internet connection to use Scratch Link.
Can I connect to hardware extensions?
Play Basketball
Move in front of the distance sensor to bounce the ball.
Press the buttons to play saxophone and drums.
Space Tacos
Build your own controller to catch tacos in space.
New sound effects (such as "faster" "slower" "echo" and "robot")
What happened to the Scratch Tips Window?
Instead of the Tips Window Scratch 3.0 provides similar material through the Tutorials Library which can be accessed through the Tutorials link in the top navigation bar in the programming editor. You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like "Make a Chase Game") or specific blocks and features (such as "Record a Sound" or "Make it Spin"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as "Pong Game" and "Make It Fly").
What is a remix?
When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example by changing scripts or costumes) the resulting project is called a "remix". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.
The Scratch online community provides a way for young people to share collaborate and learn with their peers within a moderated community governed by the Scratch {cgLink}. However we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install the Scratch app which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.
What is a Scratch Teacher Account?
A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch including the ability to create student accounts organize student projects into studios and monitor student comments. For more information on Scratch Teacher Accounts see the {eduFaqLink}.
Scratch Teacher Account FAQ
How do I request a Scratch Teacher Account?
Your password is too short. It needs to be at least 6 letters long.
The username you chose already exists. Try again with a different username.
What's your gender?
Scratch welcomes people of all genders.
This helps us understand who uses Scratch so that we can broaden participation. This information will not be made public on your account.

This plug-in allows Stellarium to send "slew" commands to a telescope on a computerized mount (a "GoTo telescope").
This will move the telescope to the selected object.
To point a device to the center of the view Press the number of the device while holding down the Alt key.
For example Alt+1 for telescope #1.
This will slew the device to the point in the center of the current view.
If you move the view after issuing the command the target won't change unless you issue another command.

subscribing invitation message this message is sent to people you invite to subscribe to the list using the INVITE command;
notice of message rejected by the moderator this message is sent to the sender of a message rejected by the moderator;
notice of message rejected because of a virus this message is sent to the sender of a message in which a virus was found.
With the 'All' value the reply is sent to both the message sender AND the list.
With the 'List' value the reply is sent to the list.
Be careful use this option carefully! Experience shows that subscribers do not always check the address to which they send their reply. Thus they might send private messages to the whole list when trying to reply to a single person
With the 'Otheremail' value the reply is sent to a predefined address. If you choose this option you will have to indicate an email address in the 'Other email address' input box.
With the 'Sender' value the reply is sent to the message sender. This is the option you should probably choose.
Mailing lists - Owner and moderator guide
Introduction who is in charge of managing mailing lists?
Reminder a mailing list service involves four types of roles
listmaster;
owner;
SET list NOCONCEAL subscriber address visible via REView
INDEX list receive the list of the archive files
GET list file receive a file of the list archive
LAST list receive the list's most recent message
Commands for list owners
which options will be available to manage lists (scenario definition)
what the default files will contain (creation of templates)
what will the mailing list web interface look like;
set the way the mailing list service should be used and document those rules through providing charters to subscribers moderators and owners;
approve of requests of mailing list creations;
In order to avoid any list overload try and delete useless files as you go along. A good organization of the list will allow you to manage the shared document web space more easily. To save some space you can also publish your files in compressed formats.
Publishing a bookmark on a list
To publish a bookmark on a list do as follows
Browse the folder in which you want to publish your bookmark. Create a new folder if necessary.
In the 'title' field enter a descriptive name for the website to be linked through the bookmark.
browse the different sections displayed on the list environment homepage;
search for a list via the search box the searched string will return all the lists whose name or description matches your search criteria (descriptions of the lists generally consist of a short sentence);
click on the 'List of lists' tab on top of page to display all available lists.
According to the domain to which your email address belongs (example cru.fr fai.com etc.) and to the location you log on from you will not have access to the same lists. However you can subscribe to a list that does not display if you know its name. To do this use your email client.

About ExoneraTor
The ExoneraTor service maintains a database of IP addresses that have been part of the Tor network.nbsp; It answers the question whether there was a Tor relay running on a given IP address on a given date.nbsp; ExoneraTor may store more than one IP address per relay if relays use a different IP address for exiting to the Internet than for registering in the Tor network and it stores whether a relay permitted transit of Tor traffic to the open Internet at that time.

Number of audio buffers
This is the number of audio buffers on which the power measurement is made. A higher number of buffers will increase the response time of the filter to a spike but will make it less sensitive to short variations.

This linear gain will be applied in software.

IDR interval
For H.264 IdrInterval specifies IDR-frame interval in terms of I- frames; if IdrInterval=0 then every I-frame is an IDR-frame. If IdrInterval=1 then every other I-frame is an IDR-frame etc. For MPEG2 IdrInterval defines sequence header interval in terms of I-frames. If IdrInterval=N SDK inserts the sequence header before every Nth I-frame. If IdrInterval=0 (default) SDK inserts the sequence header once at the beginning of the stream.
Rate Control Method

We should be able to board a ship at Blackwater Port but it seems the orcs are heading there too. Rebels who hate Asheviere and are loyal to the memory of the king desperately hold the port as it is one of the only places where they can ship supplies and weapons.
Delfador some orcs are following us! We must make haste!
Delfador my old friend! We had heard of your coming and of the attacks on the elves. It is good to see you again although I would prefer it were not in such sad times.
It seems the orcs have come here too to try to wrest this port from our hands. Our defenses are still weak but reinforcements will arrive soon!
I fear I will struggle to do this on my own but what must be must be. How do I get to Elensefar?
Since you have broken the orcs’ hegemony over the seas going by ship would be safest. Sail along the coast and you can land mere miles from Elensefar. Make haste!
With the orcs controlling the seas going by ship would not be safe. Travel by land Elensefar is only six days’ march up the coast. Make haste!

There they are! Charge!
Thank you Lord El’rien. The hospitality of the North Elves is as generous as that of your kin in the south! My men will help you hold out against our enemies.
Konrad you have made it to the domain of the North Elves. Continue moving east and let the elves guard your rear.
We have not yet reached the forest and the battle still rages. We are caught between two vast armies and cannot escape to safety! We are defeated!
Elf-friends you have made it to safety!
The noble leaders of many troops Lords are especially strong in melee combat and also possess skill with the bow. Like Commanders Lords possess leadership skills and improve the fighting ability of all adjacent lower-level units.

I cannot believe what my eyes are seeing! The flesh runs from their bones these are not human warriors we fight. They are evil spirits masquerading as human!
Their human aspect is returning! This is an evil manner of sorcery we face but one that we may yet overcome. CHARGE!
Who are you? What are you?
Help I hope. Circumstances cannot afford to get much more dire.
Riders approach from the northwest! Stand fast men.

Amazing. Lord Maddock sent his house guards his finest troops! Elensefar must be defenseless now. More hinges on this battle than I thought.

Elvish reinforcements! Where did these come from? I thought the elvish resistance to the treaty was smaller than this. Hurry up and move those caravans!

Next in our story Rugnur retreated into the caves of Knalga. But the elves pressed on and would enter the caves shortly.
Oh what?
Just use my gold and coal I have enough! Or if they’re not ‘good enough’ for you find them yourself.
You try my patience Durstorn. You know yours aren’t acceptable but you have to give me something or I can’t make the sceptre!
So we will go to the eastern mines!
Fine. As for the jewels I will have others obtain those. That will cost quite a bit of our payment but it can’t be helped. Our people do not mine jewels.
Move Rugnur to the northeast cave entrance
Move Alanin to the southern border east of the river
Well Thursagan has reached a conclusion. He can’t make the sceptre with the materials he has here but he has the final plans for it and all the jewels and gold he needs. Shouldn’t we leave now?
Yes of course let’s just all be cowards! What happened to your honor Durstorn?!
You little fool honor is less important than life! So I’m ordering Thursagan to give the plans and the ruby to the elves as a peace offering. Then maybe we’ll walk out of here alive.
Very well my lord.
The sceptre would not be found until many generations after Haldric II in the time of Asheviere the Dark Queen. During that time it sat in the caves of the Northlands unfound but undestroyed moved around by Orcs who never understood its true power.
Caravan
Caravans are used to carry gold or supplies long distances. Because of the immense weight of the cargo this caravan carries it moves very slowly.

Lady Outlaw
She’s clever! Maybe I made the wrong choice. Well at least she left some of her gold behind
Son you must lead our people through the south pass. I will remain behind to hold off these vile monsters for as long as I can.
Without the help of these tree-folk we’ll be trapped in these woods till we die! There will be nothing to hold the orcs back!
Stupid tree-folk.
On this day you have proved yourself to be a tree-friend. For so long your kind has only come with sharp blades to harm my kind. You come to build these buildings of stone. Our roots may be slow but they are strong. We will eventually claim all of the stones back for the earth.
Well I suspect you won’t have to worry about my kind for much longer. The orcs have come and they are taking this Isle!
Hmmmm— my kind were here before your kind and we will be here after the orcs are gone as well. We were here before all others and I suspect that we will be here in the end.
Sounds good to me.
Prince Haldric must be the first into the sewers of Southbay.

The plan revolved around some orcs making it back to the Green Isle to tell their kin that the elves have the Ruby of Fire so we wouldn’t have to bear the brunt of the next invasion.
What have we done?
My love my family I’ll be there soo—
Jevyan— I spit upon thee. Your end awaits. My love my family I’ll be there soo—
No. Why? You fools you gave the Ruby of Fire to the elves. But that won’t save you from me. I will destroy you then I will deal with the elves.

Walking Corpse
Walking Corpses are the bodies of the dead re-animated by dark magic. Though not especially dangerous to a trained soldier the sight of one’s former comrades amongst their number is frightening to say the least.
Ancient Lich
Grand Knights have reached the acme of skill with sword and lance. Wearing full plate and riding steeds bred more for power than for speed these warriors form the core of any serious cavalry force. A grand knight at the head of a charge is a terrifying sight for infantry and is often enough to break right through a defensive line.
Horsemen of skill and discipline are promoted to Knights. Veterans of combat they have seen the often-fatal results of a failed charge and have learnt discretion in its use. Knights therefore carry swords in their armament and practice tactics which although requiring of much more patience are less risky than a charge. Their lances are still at the ready however and growing experience with these weapons makes them deadlier at the tilt.
Lancer
Lancers are among the bravest and most feared riders in all of Wesnoth. Clad in minimal armor they free themselves to ride swiftly faster than any of their peers. The daring tactics they employ are like a double-edged sword for they often win either glory or a swift death. Lancers excel in hunting down infantrymen who have made the mistake of breaking formation and in piercing defensive lines. However they have limited use in defense.

Dang. I was sure I saw an oasis here. Must have been a mirage. I’ve been out in the sand for too long.
I will not kill you in cold blood. But leave these lands and never darken our path again. Or I will show you no mercy.
I will take this vial in exchange for your life. But leave these lands and never darken our path again. Or I will show you no mercy.
Miraculously all of our encampments survived the night.
Well only $elvencamps encampments remain but we will survive.
Yes but at what cost?
Though we saved almost all our people this time we won’t always be so lucky. While elves who have fought with you in the past will gladly return as the numbers of our people dwindle it’s going to become more and more costly to recruit new warriors. It would be wise to stockpile gold against this eventuality.
We have suffered losses but we are not broken yet. We have saved most of our people tonight.

Hail friend. Ages ago I too fought the trolls and came to this place. But by ill luck I was burned to death by the lava and died nearby unblessed and unhonored. Find my body and grant me the peace I so dearly wish for. Do this and I will let you pass.
May Eloh or whatever god you worship grant you peace and safe passage to the afterlife. We will avenge your death.
Crypt Guardian
This looks like a troll crypt. Whoever it was must have been very important because they have their own undead guardian.
On behalf of all trolls Darmog thank you for great victory over the dwarves. You have helped drive back the nasty dwarves and given us time to strengthen our defenses. Us trolls not always enemies of dwarves. Until recently we not have much contact with small people. But dwarves invade our tunnels defile our holy places and kill our women and young. Dwarf not care about anything except gold and pretty gems. The shamans say that the spirits of our kin cry out for vengeance and Darmog will not rest until every dwarf is dead!
But I am curious we do not know of your kind. We thank you for your help but who are you and why do you come down here with so many of your people?
You rescued Nog’s brother and he died like a warrior in battle not like a coward in chains. Nog is very grateful. You proved yourselves to be brave strong warriors and Nog will help you find way back to lighted lands.
The trolls who fought with you also want to thank you. They tell great tales of your valor.
We thank you for all you have done for trolls. You are bravest small people we know. We will tell stories of your battles to all our families so that none will forget. We wish we could come with you and fight more but Great Leader need us to protect this city. Many dwarves still left much fighting still to do. Griknagh will protect us may he watch over you too.

It seems that the temple had some power left in it after all.
I have no idea what they just said but their meaning is quite clear.
Actions speak louder than words and I intend to send them back to whatever stygian pits they came from!
Undead don’t have to breathe and I don’t think a little water is going to stop them. Besides you saw how the ghost just flew through the rock; if they can move through walls then what do they care about flooded tunnels?
Great. So now we’re fighting in a haunted valley.
Undead Leader
I don’t understand. What are these humans doing here? I’ve never seen so many in one place before.
But now is not a time for preaching. Humans once spread to many lands and despite all the ravages of time I have no doubt that at least a few of them have survived. They are a hardy people and quickly adapt to new conditions. I only wish that the same could be said of our brethren.
As I envy your kind’s prowess when fighting in the water.
Yantili
Thank you for rescuing me. I never imagined that we would actually be able to find you elves. Our master was right after all. But more of that later
Il-tian
Thank you for rescuing me. May the Sea God’s bounty bless you and protect you. If you have any wounded I can help heal them. The blades of the vile humans are terrible indeed.
The humans of the Iron Council dwell in a large island to the northwest; I was taken there several times for interrogation. It is a fearsome place full of black rock and tall peaks but in the center is a lagoon. In the lagoon I saw several ships anchored which we might be able to use to transport your people across the waves.
Wherever you go Kaleh I will follow.
Very well. You have not led us astray so far I will not leave you now.
We have attacked the humans in the past when their boats trespass in our waters and so they fear us greatly. Their dark mages have cast protective spells upon their boats preventing any of our kind from boarding them. I am afraid that we cannot capture the boats for you. We will of course help you hold off the humans. Later once we escape with your help I think we can dispel the protections but for now you must seize them yourselves.
Truly there are not as many of us as there once were.
I say good riddance. He creeped me out.
Naga Leader
I have captured the keep. This castle is somewhat ruined but it will serve our purposes. Now I wonder where the merfolk are?
Fear not here we are! We have explored the southern half of the island. And except for those lizards you found and some abandoned villages it seem to be empty. We captured those villages for you to help support your troops.
Thanks I think we’re going to need all the support we can get.
Although I am not as devout as Zhul is I thank Eloh every day that Nym survived that horrible battle in the Black Citadel. No one has been more enthusiastic than she in embracing our life among the islands. She delights in swimming and sailing among the shallows and spends so much time in the water that sometimes I think she is half mermaid herself. Her sparkling laugh and quick wit are a daily gift to us. She entertains the children with thrilling (though often slightly embellished) tales of our great journey and at times when I get moody she reminds me what a joy it is to be alive in this great land. She is a living testament to the fact that even though we were born among the sands we can thrive anywhere we have the will to live.
So much has happened since we left the desert but looking back upon our journey I do not want to forget Garak and his sacrifice. I doubt that we would have made it out of the sands alive if it was not for his strength and guidance. I remember how he used to smile when charging into battle and how he would pray over the bodies of his fallen friends afterwards. I think of him sometimes buried in the sands with his fellow warriors. I think he would have been proud of us. He was both a great warrior and a great teacher. He will be remembered.
Actually I just finished.
Yes it feels good to finally be done.

Four tribes struggle with their nearest neighbor to be the first to reach the mountain of gold that promises riches beyond belief. But can the two remaining ones share the resources wisely?
Dolomites
The jewel of the Alps the Dolomites mountain range has been declared a World Heritage Site for its pristine beauty. This map is an as-faithful-as-reasonable reconstruction of the area delimited by Cortina d’Ampezzo in the north-east and Canazei in the south-west. If you have to be pitted in a duel to the death against your enemies it may as well be in a beautiful place.
Island Hopping is a traditional tournament in Atlantean culture. The rules of the game are simple you start with a headquarters on an island. When you finish a castle at the end of the first island you are granted a second headquarters on a second island which will contain all wares from your first headquarters.
If you finish a castle in the target area on the second island you will get a third headquarters on the third island. You must build a castle at the center of the third island and hold it for 20 minutes to win the game.
Whenever you finish an island you will get bonus wares depending on how many players have finished the island before you. The earlier you finish the fewer wares you will get. See below for the details.
The point is that the first island only provides rocks and trees the second only meadows and resources. The economies you leave behind will continue to work for you but you will only reap the benefits at the moment you reach a new island.
Finally be careful not to waste your quartz and diamonds.
Our building infrastructure is finished and I spent some days making sure that everybody is working well together. Now there are other pressing matters. I called Colionder my personal cook before me to get his help with sorting some things out.
Colionder Arrives
May Satul warm you Jundlina. Can I be of any service to you or the god?
Jundlina Replies
May Satul warm you too Colionder. Yes I wondered if there is a way that we could centralize our food production. We lose a lot of productivity because our people are accustomed to making their own food. I feel if we could split responsibilities it would be better for us all. I want your thoughts on this.
A normal mine can only dig up about one third of all the resources that lie beneath it; then it must be enhanced to a deep mine in order to keep it working properly. To enhance a building choose it and then click the appropriate button in the appearing window.
Workers gain experience by successful work. With enough experience they become more advanced workers who are necessary to operate the enhanced buildings. Do not enhance a building before you have enough advanced workers to operate the advanced building!
Such buildings usually have greater demands than the basic kind of that building – for instance deep mines need snacks instead of rations. You will have to enhance your tavern to an inn in order to produce snacks out of pitta bread AND a second kind of food (meat or fish) AND beer.
You may of course enhance all mines to deep mines instantly given you have the workers – bigger mines work a bit faster smaller mines need cheaper food. It’s up to you which strategy you prefer.
Build a wood hardener
As I just discovered we are running short on blackwood! We cannot put our warriors into some crumbling huts and even less so in times as dangerous as ours!
We need a wood hardener and we need one now!
Boldreth smiles
Well old friend this should ensure that our fortifications do not break down with our foes’ first battle cry! Now we can expand safely!
Still it would not hurt to accumulate some grout for our further campaign; thus we could in times of need build a fortress such as the world has never seen before!
Mountains Found
I have just spoken to the leader of our patrol. He told me that they found some mountains to the north-east and east of our territory. With a bit of luck this will open up a new chance for rearming our men because as far as I remember most of the mountains west of Al’thunran hold coal and some metal ores.
Mining Economy Completed
I just got informed that our mining economy has started its work. This news brought a smile to my face – even if the hardest part is still waiting to be done now that our smiths will give their best to further ease our lives.
Fortress Needed
Of course this means you will need more resources for preparing this food – like fish meat or bread.
To provide these foodstuffs you can build a fisher’s house a hunter’s house a farm a mill and a bakery.
Build a brewery and a winery to supply the miners with some good and strong drinks.
Maybe you will also need a piggery a vineyard and some wells.
It’s up to you what you want to build. But remember – coal and iron mines need beer marble and gold mines need wine and all mines need at least rations which are produced out of bread OR meat OR fish.

Amalea is Very Content
Amalea is clapping her hands
Lutius. Well done. Well done. We have discovered all possible port locations in the complete region. Now we can strengthen our economy and we will manage to sail home soon.
Amalea’s Counsel
Salve Lutius. We just completed our weaving mill. Now we are very close to taking to the sea again. However I thought it would be helpful to remind you that ship production is not the only industry that needs cloth.
Lutius greets the official
Ave! Who are you and what happened to our beautiful land?
Difficult Times
Lutius accepts the challenge
Mayor we have to thank you for your efforts to safeguard our city. And we will do our very best to recover from the chaos. But unfortunately this seems to be very difficult.
Defeated!
Amalea reports our defeat
Oh no Lutius I don't know how this could have happened but the Barbarians have sacked our headquarters. So we have lost this battle and our empire!
Amalea reports our headquarters lost
Oh no Lutius I don't know how this could have happened but the Barbarians have destroyed our headquarters. So we can't deliver the wares to Julia anymore.
I have asked Hauke one of my advisors to oversee the construction of our settlement.
The first buildings
Peace Chieftain Reebaud! I will start with the colonization of the island straight away.
Like all Frisians we build our houses mainly with bricks. We improve them by adding some logs and granite. The roofs are thatched with reed naturally. Nothing is better suited to keep the rain out.
We should start by taking care of our wood production. Trees don’t seem to grow well on this island; better build at least two houses for foresters and one for a woodcutter.
The north looks not very useful to us but who knows what we might find in the south?
Train and recycle
Recycle Weapons to Regain Metal
When soldiers train their old weapons are discarded. They can be turned into metal in a recycling center. Use the weapons in the store to train soldiers and recycle some scrap metal.
The blacksmithy only produces a pick in its second production cycle. If it is supplied with only one iron ingot at a time it might never reach this cycle. You need to stop the blacksmithy until at least two iron are stored in its input queue.
The Empire is Angry
Hostes Imperii estis!
Barbarians! You have refused my offer of friendship most ungraciously by destroying the beautiful building we presented you with!
You are enemies of the Empire and I shall treat you as such!
Barbarians! You have refused my offer of friendship most ungraciously by basely wasting your precious resources on expansion!
Everything except for big buildings can be built on a yellow house symbol.
Red building symbols can only hold small buildings and flags.
And finally the yellow flag symbol only allows for flags.
If you place something on a field the surrounding fields might have less space for holding buildings so choose your fields wisely.
If you decide you do not want to build a road at this time you can cancel road building by clicking on the starting flag of the road and selecting the abort symbol.
Since the construction will take some time you can change the game speed using Page Up and Page Down.
The Battle Arena Has Been Constructed
Very good. Our battle arena has been finished and the soldiers are already walking towards it.
The needed wares are also delivered there. For successful training you need pitta bread and strong beer as well as either fish or meat.
For more information you can have a look at the building’s help window accessible via the question mark in every building’s window.
Do not forget to stop your shipyard when you have enough ships.
No Iron
We lack iron
The second ship might not be finished yet but we have an urgent problem.
As you surely have already noticed there is no iron in the mountain in the west. We have plenty of coal and gold ore but without iron ore we cannot produce any tools.
If you want you may further look up what is needed to produce the wares you just looked up.

The Barbarian war mill is their most advanced production site for weapons. As such you will need to enhance an ax workshop in order to get one.
All weapons require the same time for making but the consumption of the same raw materials increases from step to step. The last two need gold.
If the supply is steady the reindeer farm produces one meat after producing three pieces of fur.

Young soldiers are proud to learn to fight with this powerful weapon. It is heavier and sharper than the ordinary ax. It is produced in ax workshops and war mills. In training camps it is used – together with food – to train soldiers from attack level 0 to level 1.
The warrior’s ax is the most dangerous of all Barbarian weapons. Only a few soldiers ever were able to handle this huge and powerful ax. It is produced in a war mill and used – together with food – in a training camp to train soldiers from attack level 4 to level 5.
Barley is a slow-growing grain that is used for baking bread and brewing beer. It is also eaten by reindeer.
This basket is needed by the vine farmer for harvesting the grapes. It is produced by the toolsmith.
Baskets are needed by the fruit collector to gather berries. They are woven from reed and wood by the blacksmith.
Kitchen tools are needed for preparing rations and meals. They are produced in a toolsmithy and used in taverns and inns.
Logs are an important basic building material. They are produced by felling trees.
Atlanteans use logs also as the base for planks which are used in nearly every building. Besides the sawmill the charcoal kiln the toolsmithy and the smokery also need logs for their work.
Barbarian lumberjacks fell the trees; rangers take care of the supply of trees. Logs are also used in the metal workshop to build basic tools and in the charcoal kiln for the production of coal. The wood hardener refines logs into blackwood by hardening them with fire.
Woodcutters fell the trees; foresters take care of the supply of trees. Logs are also used in the blacksmithy to build basic tools and in the charcoal kiln for the production of coal. Smokeries use logs as fuel for smoking meat and fish.

WordPress 5.3 aims to fully support PHP 7.4. This release contains multiple changes to remove deprecated functionality and ensure compatibility. WordPress continues to encourage all users to run the latest and greatest versions of PHP.
Date/Time Component Fixes
PHP 7.4 Compatibility
Developers can now work with dates and timezones in a more reliable way. Date and time functionality has received a number of new API functions for unified timezone retrieval and PHP interoperability as well as many bug fixes.
You’ll now be periodically asked to confirm that your admin email address is up to date when you log in as an administrator. This reduces the chance of getting locked out of your site if you change your email address.

Categories have hierarchy meaning that you can nest sub-categories. Tags do not have hierarchy and cannot be nested. Sometimes people start out using one on their posts then later realize that the other would work better for their content.
For most themes the header text is your Site Title and Tagline as defined in the General Settings section.
If your theme has more than one default header image or you have uploaded more than one custom header image you have the option of having WordPress display a randomly different image on each page of your site. Click the #8220;Random#8221; radio button next to the Uploaded Images or Default Images section to enable this feature.
Some themes come with additional header images bundled. If you see multiple images displayed select the one you#8217;d like and click the #8220;Save Changes#8221; button.
You can choose from the theme#8217;s default header images or use one of your own. You can also customize how your Site Title and Tagline are displayed.
This sidebar is no longer available and does not show anywhere on your site. Remove each of the widgets below to fully remove this inactive sidebar.

You can assign keywords to your posts using tags. Unlike categories tags have no hierarchy meaning there#8217;s no relationship from one tag to another.

personal certificate file not found
This installer has been prepared for {0}
The certificate chain as received in EAP was not sufficient to verify the certificate to the root CA in your profile. It was verified using the intermediate CAs in your profile though. You should consider sending the required intermediate CAs inside the EAP conversation.
The EAP server name does not match any of the configured names in your profile!
The configured EAP server name matches either the CN or a subjectAltNameDNS of the incoming certificate; best current practice is that the certificate should contain the name in BOTH places.
At least one certificate did not contain any BasicConstraints extension; which makes it unclear if it's a CA certificate or end-entity certificate. At least Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) will not validate this certificate for EAP purposes!
The server presented a certificate from an unknown authority.

Set the tempo (beats per minute) for music and arpeggios. These values are used by exercises written with these exercise modules compareintervals harmonicintervals idtone melodicinterval singchord singinterval twelvetone rhythm identifybpm nameinterval. Other exercises will either have the tempo set in the lesson file or on the config page of the exercise.
This exercise creates random intervals and you should try to identify them.
If you are using the buttons interface then you can right-click on the buttons to hear the interval they represent.
On the config page of the exercise there is a combo box where you can select different ways to answer the question. Currently there is a piano guitar bass and a few types of accordion in addition to the default buttons interface. Below is a screenshot showing the piano interface.
This is a combined tone memory and interval exercise. Some people believe this kind of exercise can give you perfect pitch (absolute pitch) but I don't believe so.
The basics are the program play a tone and you must identify it by comparing it with the last tone played for you.

Mark Download asUpdated
If set to Yes the Download is marked as 'updated' in the frontend. That means for example that you have say assigned an updated version of the file to this Download or other important data has been changed. The duration that the Download shows as being updated can be set in the configuration.
Read data from XML
When Yes the script attempts to fill out the data for this download from a XML installation file in the uploaded archive (zip or tar) file. This feature has only been tested with Joomla XML files and works only when you upload a packed .zip or .tar file. You can also use this function when you have selected (above) a file from the server.
Download data succesfully filled from .xml file. Please check the results.
Allows you to automatically truncate the view length of the short descriptions to the maximum number of characters as specified below. This is used in the Download list view in the frontend. The Short Description itself is not truncated only the view length.
Maximum number of characters to be shown
Sometimes you may have already installed a lightbox plugin. If that is the case then you can turn off the jDownloads lightbox function. It is suggested that you test with and without the jDowloads lightbox function enabled to be certain.

Unsupported packages
Please realize that the following software is either unsupported or requires an additional customer contract for support.
PurposeThis tool lets you install remove and update applications.Software in product; is broken down and distributed in the form of packages. This way if multiple applications require a common system file this system file is shipped in its own package and is installed only once if needed. The user need not be concerned about such underlying dependencies. Likewise the plugins and other non-essential data of a given application may be shipped in their own packages so the user may install them only if needed.

A list of all iSCSI nodes are displayed by discovery domain.  Selecting another discovery domain refreshes the list with members from that discovery domain.  It is possible to Add an iSCSI node to a discovery domain or Delete the node.  Deleting a node removes it from the domain but does not delete the iSCSI node Creating an iSCSI node allows a not yet registered node to be added as a member of the discovery domain.  When the initiator or target registers this node then it becomes part of this domain  When an iSCSI initiator does a discovery request the iSNS service returns all iSCSI node targets that are members of the same Discovery Domains.
At the top a list of all Discovery Domain Sets are displayed.  Discovery Domains belong to Discovery Domain Sets. A Discovery Domain must be a member of a Discovery Domain Set in order to be active. In an iSNS database a Discovery Domain Set contains Discovery Domains and Discovery Domains contain iSCSI Node members.
The discovery domain set members list is refreshed whenever a different discovery domain set is selected.

The MySQL server can ask the NDB Cluster storage engine if it knows about a table with a given name. This is called discovery. Handlerdiscover indicates the number of time tables have been discovered.
The number of times the first entry was read from an index. If this is high it suggests that the server is doing a lot of full index scans; for example SELECT col1 FROM foo assuming that col1 is indexed.
The number of requests to read a row based on a key. If this is high it is a good indication that your queries and tables are properly indexed.
The number of requests to read the next row in key order. This is incremented if you are querying an index column with a range constraint or if you are doing an index scan.
The number of requests to read the previous row in key order. This read method is mainly used to optimize ORDER BY  DESC.

Query cache min result size
The max size of the result set in the query cache is the default of 1 MiB.
Changing {querycachelimit} (usually by increasing) may increase efficiency. This variable determines the maximum size a query result may have to be inserted into the query cache. If there are many query results above 1 MiB that are well cacheable (many reads little writes) then increasing {querycachelimit} will increase efficiency. Whereas in the case of many query results being above 1 MiB that are not very well cacheable (often invalidated due to table updates) increasing {querycachelimit} might reduce efficiency.
querycachelimit is set to 1 MiB
